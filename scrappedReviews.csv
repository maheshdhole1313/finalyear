1,These are darling! I love how dainty and sparkly they are. They fit my 2nd piercing perfectly- I get worried with crawler earrings that they'll be too long. These are so cute! I'd totally buy from this seller again.
1,Absolutely stunning! I am in love with these earrings! Very fast shipping and cute packaging ❤
1,"Got these once before for me and my brides maids on my wedding day! They're perfect, mine lost a jewel somewhere along the way (a year ago, and I stored them in my coin purse, not the best place for something to beautiful!), so I decided to order another set!"
1,"I love how dainty and unique they are.  I got the gold and I'm glad I did.  You don't really notice the gold, but I feel it makes the stones pop."
1,"This is a really beautiful piece! I had been looking for a new crawler to put in my upper cartilage piercing, and it works perfect (once I figured out which one works best with my ear curve!) but it’s beautifully done and I really love the style of the baguettes in the earring! Love love love! And super quick shipping"
1,I absolutely LOVE my earrings! They are so unique and dainty. I’ve had so many compliments on them already and Connor wait to wear them for the wedding I’m in next week. I would recommend ordering from MilysDesign! My order was processed quickly and came wrapped safely in bubble wrap so the earrings wouldn’t get damaged.
1,Soooo dainty and sparkly. Can’t wait to wear them for an art-deco feel.  UPDATE: I went to bend the wire back a tad to be able to get it into my piercing hole and the whole back broke off :( hot glue won’t hold it and I’m so sad! I’ll keep the one for a mix n match look but be careful because these babies are delicate!!!
1,"These are so pretty, I've gotten lots of compliments.  If I could do it over, I'd probably go with the post backs instead of the wire, but that's just personal preference.  You do beautiful work!!!"
1,"Wasn't exactly flush to my ear like I was hoping from the picture, but I was able to move it a bit and adjust it so it was. It's beautiful otherwise! Fast shipping."
1,The pieces are beautiful and fitted. I plan on buying more soon
1,These are stunning! I absolutely love them! Same as picture!
1,"These earrings are beautiful! So dainty and classy. There’s just enough sparkle to wear them when you’re dressing up, but I also think you could wear them everyday. Very pleased with this purchase."

Buy them you won’t regret it!"
1,"Love them! They fit great and were exactly as advertised. It was my first time trying climber earrings, and I got the wire back."
1,I love how dainty and cute this is! My only wish was that the backing wasn’t a post and more of a longer ear jacket. But i love it!
1,So excited to have these on my wedding day. Wanted a little sparkle but not dangling!
1,They are beautiful!
1,I was hesitant about getting my first pair of crawlers bit glad I went for it. They're the perfect size! They also arrived super quickly

1,The earrings are beautiful! They’re smaller than I thought it would be. It’s dainty and pretty and I’m so excited to wear them. I was a little worried when I saw the package because it looked a little beat up but the earrings were well wrapped and protected.

1,"So glad I took a chance and ordered these beautiful earrings. I have minimalist taste, especially when it comes to jewelry. The earrings can be worn around the house in quarantine with a sweatshirt or in the event I go somewhere special again some day, they can easily compliment the dressiest of outfits. They make me feel pretty and I highly recommend them to anyone. This will be my go to shop for gifts for friends or when I want to treat myself."

1,Super cute!
1,So adorable!!!
1,Super pretty and delicate earrings.  Just 4 of 5 because they don’t always stay in place on my ears; I find them trailing off the end of my earlobes.  Which is still pretty but up to your personal preference. My experience with the shop was very positive. Quick shipping and well packaged. Will shop here again.
1,Very cute earrings. They stay in nicely (ear climbers are tricky so sometimes you do have to pinch the very end). These are a simple design that can be worn with pretty much anything!
1,These are even more beautiful in person! I love them!
1,Love them! They look so pretty and I can’t wait to show them off! I definitely want to purchase more for friends and family in the future!
1,"one of my favorite earrings i’ve bought so far. i love it, it has a very classy look to it but i’d wear it everyday!"
1,"I bought these adorable earrings as a birthday gift for my granddaughter. I gave her two sets and she shared the second set with me, Grammy!!  
The only thing I would have to say in regards to making them better.... they stay on your ears much more secure with a larger back on the earrings. They tend to slip down on your ear with the small earring back that they come with.
Still rate them a 5 star!!  We love  ‘em!!"
1,"I  really like the earrings,had a few compliments  already (very pretty)"
1,Beautiful earrings!! Will buy from this shop again! ❤️
1,"The owner of this store was absolutely lovely to work with - thank you! The earrings are gorgeous, too."
1,"I'm super impressed with Lucy's professionalism and how easy she is to work with. One of my earrings arrived missing a stone, and she sent me a replacement in two days. She didn't ask me to send to flawed piece back to her either, which I appreciate (shipping fees). I'll definitely buy from her again, and would encourage my friends to buy from her too. 
I love the dainty sparkle of the earrings in my chubby ear next to my larger diamonds; they look like a trellis leading to a flower. I'm very, very happy with my purchase ❣️"
1,"Love these ear climbers.
Very petite and feminine!"
1,Beautiful product. I got the post back first and it didn’t sit right so seller let me return and meanwhile I purchased a wire back which fit perfectly. Very happy!

1,"They are so pretty!! Unfortunately my ears start itching when I have them on so I  guess I'm allergic to them. Also, I chose the post back and the tail of the earrings kept sliding down instead of staying up in place. I do not recommend the post back. If your ears aren't as sensitive as mine to certain earrings then I do recommend these cuz they are really pretty, its just a shame it didn't work out for me."

1,"I ordered the smallest size and they are so simple and pretty, hanging just below my earlobe. I love them."
1,These were a lot smaller than I was expecting it they are really cute. Great quality.
1,"Super cute earrings, but more importantly I was shocked by how comfortable they are, nothing pokes into your head like the backs of normal earrings. The only issue I have is that they can definitely fall out easily so be careful if you are for some reason moving around on a bed 🤷🏼‍♀️"
1,Simple and beautiful earrings. Love them.

1,Incredible earrings I know my girlfriend will love them! Came in a nice little box perfect for a gift.
1,fast shipping and beautiful earrings
1,"I was looking for an earring I could leave in and not worry about losing or falling off. No one wants to lose their real diamonds. These have stayed in for 4 days now and have not bothered my ears. I have not received compliments on them, my sister told me they look fake and she wouldn’t buy them. But that’s what sisters do. I think these are just fine for my purposes and will be keeping them in. Fast shipping as well"

1,Beautiful earrings but very hard to handle
1,"I needed help with my order, but I have yet to hear back from the owner."
1,They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry
1,The pictures don’t do it justice! Beautiful piece of jewelry! I get so many compliments!
1,Absolutely gorgeous! I've gotten so many compliments. Highly recommend!
1,"I love them! Very subtle and elegant!  It did take quite a while for me to receive them.  But since I ordered them during the holiday seasons and it's overseas shipping, I understand the delay.  The owner responded quickly to my message regarding the shipping delay.  So I am very happy with the purchase:)"
1,Very lovey petite design. I adore them! The perfect ear decor for any occasion!
1,"dispatch and packaging was impecabble and very tasteful
i love the earrings, the only tricky bit is making them stay up when it catches on my hair"
1,"Even more beautiful than in the photos. The opals are mesmerizing! 

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
1,They are stunning I’m obsessed!
1,"So schön und mit dem tollen Opal ein richtiger Hingucker. Ich habe mir im Nachgang noch den passenden Armreif bestellt. 
Da man den Bügel leicht biegen kann, kann man die Halterung schön ans Ohr anpassen."
1,"It did ship on time and was very nicely wrapped and boxed! Lovely earrings...but the first time I attempted to put them in my ears, the post s broke off. Now I have to try to glue these tiny things on so that I can wear them...they obviously were not flexible , at all! Very disappointing. Especially because they were so important to me...the moon phases...and unique! :(:("

DIe Lieferung war schnell und unkompliziert.

Vielen Dank!"
1,I love these earrings. They are so cool looking!!! Very happy with my purchase.

1,"These are beyond adorable!!! Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, but when I contacted the seller, she explained why and told me a more accurate time I would expect them. Once they shipped out, they arrived within 1-2 weeks. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!"
1,"Bought for my daughter for Valentine's  day and could not be happier with my purchase. Shipped fast, lovely packaging. Earnings are stunning. Delicate and glowing. Perfect for my girl who wears minimal jewelry and who I love to the moon."

1,"Beautiful, arrived on time, girlfriend loved them"
1,Beautiful earrings! They are very unique and fit nicely!
1,"Wunderschöne ausgefallene Ohrstecker/-klemmen,alles bestens gelaufen"
1,Lovely earrings! One thing to beware is that these funky bars do not hold very well and my mother lost one the very first time she was wearing it. Highly recommend purchasing little rubber backers to add to the bar to hold these in place.
1,Beautiful earrings.  Well made and well worth the wait due to the virus.  Thanks!
1,My daughter loves them!  Came quickly and well packaged. TY!
1,"Schnelle Lieferung, gute Verpackung, schöne Ware."

1,Lovely! Arrived very quickly and I’m very pleased with them.
1,"These are lovely and simple, just as pictured and described, and were shipped very quickly in time for Christmas even though they had a long trip across the Atlantic. Danke sehr!"
1,"Schnelle Lieferung, sehr schön und zierlich, gut anzupassen"
1,Einfach wunderschön ... alleine diese Idee der Anreihung des wachsenden Mondes ... dies wird sicher eine erste Bestellung sein :)
1,"These ear climbers are super pretty, I love the style but for some reason they hurt my ears and caused lots of irritation. I do not have sensitive skin and always clean earrings before I wear them so I’m not sure what the issue is for me. Anyway, I’ve ordered the sterling silver ones of the same story and hope my ears are happier. I really like this shop, such pretty and interesting jewelry!"
1,Vielen Dank - tolles Schmuckstück!
1,"Sehr hübsch. Wie angegeben, einwandfreie Lieferung, gerne wieder"
1,Son muy finos. Y llegaron en la fecha previstas
1,Adore these earrings! Thank you!
1,"My daughter loved these, I gave them as a gift.
They were shipped and received quickly. Thank you."
1,Darling earrings. Would recommend for the climber style choice.
1,Love!  Bought these for my friend and was a little nervous because she has small ears but they look adorable on her and she loves them.
1,sympa à porter fin et coloré discretement
1,"Very pretty, fast shipping!"
1,Schnelles Versenden und sehr hochwertiger Schmuck - gerne wieder! :)
1,"Great, but a pair I bought a while back are discolouring."
1,Absolutely gorgeous! I bought this as a Christmas gift for my partner and she hasn't stopped wearing them. Thank you!
1,Absolutely gorgeous the earrings were exactly as pictured
1,"The design is cute, this is CLEARLY not opals. They look like plastic buttons."
1,"Really nice + comfortable earrings, I love them!"
1,"Beautifully and thoughtfully packaged, shipped on time; Unfortunately the earrings don't lay completely flat upwards along the ear meaning that I had to make sure to readjust ie. reposition them onto my ear. I think gently pushing down on the bracket should help keep it in place in future. 
Still a pretty and unique piece of jewelry."
1,"Great earrings - they were a gift, and she loves them! Many thanks!"
1,Beautiful art worn as earrings!
1,"These are amazing!
I bought them as a gift and almost kept them myself because I loved them so much!

1,Very communicative with shipping delays that were a result of Covid. Thanks so much!
1,"Although there was a problem with my initial purchase, the shop owner contacted me quickly to resolve. Customer service is awesome, and jewelry is suoer cute :)"
1,"I’m happy with the earrings although I’m still trying to find a way to wear them that I do not need to put them back in place from time to time.
Not sure if they fit every type or ear.
Still I like them a lot, they are as they look in the pictures"
1,absolutely lovely jewelery and amazing service as usual. thank you!
1,Gift for my friend for her birthday. She had her baby on a full moon.🌕
1,really pretty and they actually stay up on your ears
1,They look beautiful & arrived very quickly!
1,Beautiful product and fast shipping! Thanks.
1,Earrings were a gift-arrived in plenty of time-had a slight issue but it was resolved quickly with no problems-very nice!
1,My girlfriend loved it
1,They were exactly what I was looking for and wanted
1,"Perfect gift, she was SO thrilled."
1,Nice earrings but the mechanism that holds them along my ear lobe doesn’t always hold and they slip down.
1,"Purchased as a gift for a friend who loooved this pair, wears separately at times too"
1,Earrings were poorly manufactured. Broken out of packaging. Cute concept
1,"Pretty but needed to return product to  arriving too late. Now getting frustrated trying to see if this is resolves I keep getting the ring around and people keep having.me email different folks to find out how to return these earrings,  I would not reccomend ordering from this site again if I can't get it resolved in the week ne"
1,Very nice.  Received on time as well.
1,unfortunately it broke before I could use it :(
1,"The packing was nice, but one of the earrings was bent and I still wore it; however the earring fell off and I lost it the same day i received it. The earring that was bent would not stay in my ear."
1,"This is the 4th time I’ve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren’t made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you’ll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
1,Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D
1,"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you 👌🏻"
1,Beautiful earrings! I got many compliments.
1,"This is the third set of these I have purchased. I own a pair in gold and receive so many compliments, that I’ve started gifting them to people who love them!"
1,"I've left a review before, but I have started to but these quite often as everyone who sees them likes them and comments on them, so I have a load in reserve to gift people. I adore these, they're perfect. I've tried buying from other makers who may be closer, but I haven't found anyone who makes them as well."
1,"I absolutely love ear crawlers, but this is hands on the most elegant pair I’ve ever bought. Outstanding quality and so delicate you’d almost forget you’re wearing them!"
1,"Fair wait, light, delicate and elegant I think."
1,Beautiful. Difficult to put on ear because of the double long piece. Still love it.
1,belli.. molto comodi da usare tutti i giorni
1,So cute! Love these!
1,"wonderfull earring
fast shipping 
thank you"
1,Shipped quickly and looks beautiful!
1,I have what I consider fairly normal ears and these do not stay in place no matter what I do.  Bummed.
1,"Beautiful pair of earrings, very happy!"
1,I've bought a few pairs of these now. Everyone comments on them and they make a great gift.
1,Very beautiful! Exactly as shown in the photos ☺️
1,She liked them very much.
1,She liked them very much.
1,The earrings never arrived. And the shop owner stoped answering back. Also the etsy costumer service was no help at all. Was the last time I ordered something here!!!
1,"Right now, I can only rate the item at one. I cannot properly review this item yet because it still hasn’t come in. I ordered it on November 19th and today is December 23rd. I will be very disappointed if it doesn’t come in time for Christmas.  I will be happy to change my review if it comes in before Christmas."
1,"I love ❤️ them so much. I wear them constantly and that's saying a lot for me because I very rarely wear silver, usually only hold, but I am so happy with these earrings and hey are so cool looking that I've had to adjust my preferences! Haha. Definitely get tons of inquiries and compliments. So dainty and easy to put on and they look just wonderful. Very happy with my purchase."
2,"I debated whether to dock a star on this because I ran into a hassle actually getting them, but once they arrived I decided to give 5 stars because these earrings are really great! They are an ingenious design and exactly what I wanted. I needed earrings to wear sleeping/ to keep my holes open that would be comfortable and not fall out. They fit very securely and look great! Also, the seller puts them in a little bottle for presentation- so cool, and I can use the tiny bottle for something else. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase even though I ran into a snafu with actually getting them."
2,"I really liked my earrings. They're a bit bigger on me than on the model, but I do have small ears. They also arrived a bit on the late side, but I did order them during the holidays, and the shop owner was very attentive about the situation, so I'm still giving a five star review. Very pretty! And sturdy!"
2,I am so excited to have this!  Production time and shipping was just as suspected and the item is even better in person!  The back of it is a square rather than round which allows for a more natural fit especially in my second piercing.  Thank you so much! LOVE IT!
2,perfect fit love them !
2,Love it ❤
2,"This my new favorite earring, it fits perfectly and is so cute! Took about a month to get here, but I expected that with international shipping."
2,"Lost my first pieces in a move, sadly, but these were too cute and I rarely wear jewelry so I'm glad to buy a new pair! Easy to put on, I only notice a slight pressure when I move my ears, but they're very secure. I love the little maintenance note and brand design, and you can tell they're made with love. Also Ara's really nice and helpful with tracking info."
2,It took a while but I finally got it! Thank you it's really pretty! :)
2,I do love this piece! I think my ears are a little too small to hold them up and in place- they tend to slip down and hang vertically. Still love them!
2,"Love it !
Thanks:)"
2,"Love this jewelry! Friends like it, referring them. Now I've always got some serotonin, even if I'm not feelin it =]"
2,love it!!!
2,I love these earrings!! I wear them almost everyday. This was my first purchase on etsy and I cannot be more satisfied. Thanks Arajera!!
2,"What can I say? It's exactly as photographed, fits exactly as expected, and came thoughtfully packaged with useful instructions for care. LOVE LOVE LOVE"
2,I love these earrings so much. They arrived in plenty of time and are absolutely gorgeous!!
2,fit comfortably and come in a cute storage bottle too.
2,"It's even prettier in real life! I love my new earring, thank you :)"
2,These earrings are beautiful and unique! Really love the small bottle they were shipped in! Thank you very much!
2,Lovely them
2,"Very well packaged, and good delivery time. Note that these earrings are not great is you have thick earlobes like mine! Going to try resizing the wire for comfort."
2,"The serotonin pair of earrings are beautiful! I love wearing these on my ears. Once you figure out how to slip them on and off your ears, they are very low maintenance during the day that I almost forget I'm wearing them. It came packaged in a small jar with a care card which also make for a cute display in my jewelry area."
2,This earring is super cute and super comfortable too! Perfect for a chem nerd like me :^)
2,"This seller is AWESOME! I contacted them about a delay in my delivery. She explained they'd had some issues with their delivery company and I could get a refund or have my parcel resent. I chose for resent and I'm so glad I did! 
The packaging alone is gorgeous! The earring is so cool! I know where I will be going for presents in the future!"
2,"Perfect earrings, shipped in a tiny glass bottle, love them!"
2,"Amazing! I love it! It fits perfectly, you can wear it all day, without any discomfort."
2,"Perfecto, es tal como aparece en la web."
2,"I LOVE THESE! I go them way before I expected them! I was worried about them not fitting but they fit perfectly! They are well made and exactly what i was hoping for! I also loved the vial that it came in, it was a very nice touch!"
2,"So nice, comes in the prettiest package"
2,I adore this item. It fits really well and it's made of high quality materials. And it arrived earlier than I expected. I've already placed another order for more!
2,"Great quality, was shipped exactly on time, love it!"
2,"It looks deceptively small when you pull it out of its package but is in fact rather large on your ear- a good thing, because it can easily be seen. Fits nicely if you have multiple piercings too, I have three and it fits nicely behind the other two."
2,"These earrings are great, and the design is pretty creative. They were shipped in a glass bottle with a cork. I think this is ingenious and much better than a box most people use."
2,I have bought THREE pairs over the last few years because I’m always losing things. But I love them that much! ❤️
2,"I put the wrong US zip code in and thought package was sent to a different address. Ara was responsive and helpful when I contacted her (turns out it was sent to the right address) Lovely earrings, makes for a great gift!"
2,Beautiful item that fits perfectly!
2,I like these ear rings! Unique and fun.
2,Beautiful and well made. Thank you so so much xxx
2,Beautiful design and really good quality!  They were worth the wait and made the best gift!
2,"Lovely unique looking earring, gets lots of admiring glances. Lovely helpful seller & arrived really quickly for reasonably priced postage :)"
2,Absolutely love these!!! Thank you!!
2,Very cute!
2,This item is adorable and comes with care instructions.  I'm not a fan of shippers that make you sign for packages as I work all week. And the post office in my area is crazy nuts all the time. It took forever to get my order because I had to be home to get it. Inconvenient! Cute product
2,"What a fun idea, making earrings of different molecules! I love ear climbers as I can't wear dangling earrings for work so these are perfect. This is the third pair I ordered. Ara does the best work. I'm sure I will order again."
2,These are so amazing!! I haven't worn earrings for years & these are just so original & simple & beautiful. Thank you!
2,"Beautiful, elegant and delicate. I love both of these ear climbers. Excellent quality !"
2,"Love this and everything I've ordered from this seller! Products came with free anti-tarnishing polishing cloth and in small glass jars to protect from tarnish. Even when Etsy sent this to my wrong old address, Ara made the effort to contact the shippers and get it sent to my right address. Wonderful experience, will be buying from this store again!"
2,It fits and hugs my ear perfectly
2,"Classy and unconventional earrings, great stuff !
The packaging is lovely !"
2,"Je trouve cette boucle très belle ! 
Discret et élégant, c'est vraiment beau."
2,"This looks great on, although it is slightly big for my ear so be careful if you have smaller ears."
2,"My ear lobes are a little small for these earrings, they stick out a bit underneath. But still look great!"
2,Unique earrings and lovely packaging. Thank you so much! :)
2,I love it! It makes me feel fashionable and feminine!
2,"Really nice quality! Arrived a little later than expected, but they traveled a long way❗️packaged in a little bottle with care explanation. ❤️"
2,"The shipping took longer than expected (over a month), but the product and packaging were gorgeous and my mom was really pleased with this gift!"
2,Definitely so worth the wait!
2,"They're so cute, the only issue is the end of the bar (that goes behind the ear) pokes me. But I had some wax balls lying around the house and it was an easy fix!"
2,Seller is very accommodating. Good quality and quick delivery. Thanks so much!
2,"These are so fun!  My college freshman daughter chose these in lieu of getting more holes in her ears, for now at least!  Well made, good fit, arrived fairly fast!"
2,"I love it, even though I have freakishly small ears they almost fit perfectly, the bottom is just a little too big"
2,"Nice feedback quick service friendly
Nice tips for silver
Look amazing 
Can't wait to give it to my daughter"
2,The item I ordered was good quality and I was happy with it! However the earring I ordered was a little big for my earlobe. Other than that I was pleased with what I ordered.
2,"Little difficult to put on/wear, but overall very cute!"
2,"I love this, thank you so much!!"
2,"Unusual and very pretty ear cuff. 
I highly recommend!"
2,"perfect, i love it! thank you so much :)"
2,"A bold statement earring that is a head turner, & worth every penny."
2,A great design and fantastic quality!
2,Beautiful work! Very well crafted
2,I love the seratonin earrings!
2,"I love it, thank you!"
2,"It didn't take as long as I expected to make, and arrived in California in 2 weeks. They're well made and I love them."
2,I bought a pair of these a while ago and lost one so glad I could replace it 😊
2,Super cute! I love it
2,Happy with product.
2,I ordered the serotonin earrings for my niece. They are beautiful and I feel they are a very special present for her. Thank you so much!

2,Nicely made. Thank you!
2,Extremely beautiful. Want them all
2,It looks great and was shipped fast. I would buy from here again.
2,Very well made. I like how they go through the earring hole sideways and then climb up your earlobe. Will wear these a lot. Thank you very much.
2,"These are a bit larger on my ear than pictured, but still cool"
2,Looking forward to these bad boys being in my ears
2,Love it! So do all my girlfriends that got it for Christmas!
2,Just as described and arrived in cute little cork bottle
2,"Quick shipping to the US, really fun earring design... looks beautiful on my daughter! Thank you :)"
2,Really nice quality and package.  It sits perfectly on the ear
2,"Beautiful item, seller was excellent with communication and had adorable packaging. Thanks a bunch!"
2,Really awesome and just as expected!
2,I like that they're unique and aren't cheap looking
2,Perfect once more. Much appreciated!
2,Wonderful item. Shipping expectation was very accurate and final product is just as imagined. Would shop here again
2,"Exactly as described, and well-designed—the way they fit into the ear keeps them oriented properly while you wear them. I purchased this as a gift, and the recipient loved it!"
2,very happy with it thanks!
2,My earrings arrived yesterday. They are perfect. I have received loads of compliments. Thank you :)
2,"It shipped on time, beautiful product"
2,très décu ne tient pas le bijoux est trop lourd
2,"They're cute! Bigger than you'd think, and took a long time to ship (ordered May 10, shipping process started May 24, and received June 7), but I dig 'em. It really struggles to stay in the correct orientation though. It falls over unless I make it really tight (much tighter than the dopamine I also have), which kinda makes my ear bright red and hot, but price of happiness ammirite?"
2,Very beautifully made and it is very sturdy and of high quality. the only thing i would complain about is that my earlobes are too small to fit the whole thing >:
2,The item is perfect! Thank you so much :)
2,"Super cute earrings and shipping was speedy
Great transaction. Thank you!"
2,These are so cute!  Great gift!
2,Just as pictured. I've already gotten a compliment on the first day wearing it :)
2,Love the concept and I am sure my daughter will love the earring!
2,It's really comfortable and matches the description and picture.
2,"This item was exactly as described and arrived in a timely fashion.  However, I ordered a second ear cuff and was anticipating giving it as a Christmas gift to my best friend.  The shop failed to ship the second cuff, despite ordering it before their Christmas cutoff, and left me scrambling days before to find a suitable replacement gift."
2,Exactly as described. Lovely piece of jewellery.
2,it is a very cute cuff
2,"These are beautiful and nerdy. They tend to slide off my ear a bit, but I don't think they ever risk falling out."
2,Great item! Thanks so much!
2,"Just lovely, and very comfortable to wear!"
2,"A gift for my daughter, she loved this!"
2,i bought these as a birthday present for my 13 year old daughter. she loves them and people are constantly complementing her.
2,Very lovely earings thanks
2,Lovely earrings :) Thank you!
2,"Lovely item, arrived on time."
2,It was a nice presentation putting the earrings in the tube
2,"The post of this earring is too thick and doesn't fit in my pierced ear lobe. It's a shame because it's very cute and well made, but I am not able to wear it at all."
2,"Looks exactly as I expected, however the metal bar that goes through the ear was too large for my ear piercings. It was painful trying to get them in. I haven't had this issue with other earrings."
2,My ear-climbers just arrived! They are the nicest earrings I've ever owned and I couldn't be happier with them! The quality is amazing 😊
2,Sehr schöne Ohrringe! Sehen sehr edel aus. Lieferung dauerte da. 4 Wochen.
2,Ich dache es handelt sich um ein rechts links Pärchen. Abgesehen davon sind sie sehr schön
2,"MAGNIFIQUE !!!! Merci
Un cadeau qui va ravir ma fille
Super boutique, envoi dans les délais, tout est parfait;"
2,Cute crawlers. Just want I wanted!
2,I get so many compliments on these! My new earwear look for the fall!
2,"Simple but have the lingering charm, like it very much!"
2,"Beautiful! A very good Quality. 
Everything is perfect 👍😊"
2,I love these!!  I  never take them out. They stay put where as all other earclimbers wouldn't.
2,"Love these earrings, great fit and length. I screwed up my shipping address and the customer service was amazing! Thank you!"
2,They fit perfectly and they look so cute!
2,"Its just cool looking, I keep compliments all the time!"
2,Beautiful earrings - my husband loves them even more than I do (which is a lot)!
2,Gotta love this ear bar! Highly recommended shop!
2,"I love these earrings and have been wearing them daily for about 2 months. They are comfortable, shipped within the timeframe and I get a tone of compliments on them."
2,Great pair of earrings! sleek and minimalist and just what I wanted. I'm wearing them right now!
2,Love this ear climber. I’ve ordered others where the post that goes behind the ear wasn’t as robust and after repeated wearing the post would break off from tightening and loosening. This one seems like it’ll hold up much better.
2,Perfect fit and adds some edge
2,Love them. Smooth elegance. The fit is comfortable and it stays in place.
2,Très contente de mon achat et envoi très rapide!
2,Love these! They are so pretty and comfortable to sleep with too
2,Quality and at a great price ❤️
2,Receive so many compliments on these unique earrings!
2,Gave these as a gift. They're perfect and look great.
2,"Conforme à la photo, parfait! merci"
2,Very thin! Just as I expected. If you’ve ever worn an earring like this you may have to adjust the width to keep it secure and I can do that with this earring with out fear of it snapping or losing its proper shape.
2,"Shipping kinda took a while, which I expected but they are great! They sometimes catch on my hair and slip off my ear but they’re so easy to slide back into place."
2,Very nice minimalist style. Unique and good price. They fit perfectly. Thank you!
2,My new favorite earrings! The perfect everyday pair!
2,"Très, (trop selon moi) discret..! Conforme à la description cependant !"
2,Very cute and fits nicely!
2,Très beau produit ! :-)
2,Very cool. Had to give mine away to my friend from Norway. So unique and the also stay in well.
2,These are so cool. I get compliments whenever I wear them!
2,"Alles in Ordnung, sehr schön, mal was anderes 😃"
2,"extremely cute and stylish, thank you for the fast shipping as well!!"
2,"This seller is very sweet and cares about her customers. Unfortunately, I did have an issue with my order but she made it better and fair. I will most probibly try another one of her products in the future. Thanks B!"
2,Beautiful piece. I can't stop wearing them!
2,My friend loved these for her Christmas present!!
2,perfect.  just what I asked for.
2,Very light and more confortable than I expected. I'm very pleased.
2,Still waiting to receive these earrings for my daughters 30th Birthday.
2,"I saw the crawler trend a while ago and decided I'd hop onto it. I absolutely fell in love with the earrings as soon as I received them, and I've liked them more and more every day. I have worn them every day and gotten numerous compliments. They are inexpensive yet unique. I honestly would recommend this shop to a friend :)"
2,"Absolutely love these! I received the order in less than 2 days, and it looks exactly like pictured! I will definitely buy more from this shop. Really really cute items. :)"
2,"I get compliments on these star climbers every time I wear them! It was a tiny learning curve getting them in (I’m old), but I love them!"
2,Absolutely love them!!
2,I bought these and the leaf ones - love them both. They´re super pretty and no problem to slip on. They stay in place nicely.
2,"Minimal and perfect for anyone. Earrings are light weight, which I like and made well. Will buy again!"
2,Yaaaas! Love them!
2,The jewelry is so unique and shipping was quick especially for overseas !!! Would recomend to others 💕💕💕
2,Earrings came SUPER FAST & are SUPER CUTE. I get compliments at least once/day. Will definitely be buying more soon!
2,New favorite pair of earrings! They are a little bit on the flimsy side in my opinion so I am careful with them but absolutely love them overall!
2,"Gorgeous! This is my first set of ear climbers, and I love mixing and matching them with other earrings for asymmetrical looks. <3"
2,"I got a pair of Moon Phases and a pair of Stars. I decided to wear one of each. They are so cute, I love them!"
2,Love these dainty star ear climbers!  They also shipped super fast :)
2,"Love everything about this star crawler. It’s beautiful and easy to put on. Also came super quick! I loved it so much, I bought it in silver as well."
2,Order was shipped the day I placed the order!!! I thought maybe that it was just the label being created but the package came almost two weeks early! Love how speedy this was especially with it being the holidays. Very happy with the purchase and the maker/seller. I've been wearing my pair for well over a year and they're still looking great and this pair was bought for a friend who constantly adores me earrings.
2,My earrings came today and I loooove them. They actually shipped the day I ordered them and they came super fast. They are really lightweight and comfortable! Would buy again!
2,"Beautiful earrings, I’ve received many compliments!! Great quality too!!"
2,Perfect fit for my ears. So delicate. They add just the right amount of sparkle.

2,I got complements on these the first day I wore them! They look great and fit great! Some of the best ear crawler earrings I've purchased!
2,"I received them this afternoon & put them on on the way to a dinner - noticed & loved by family right away. The earrings are simple, effortless but dress up the outfit easily."
2,I am delighted with these cute little earrings! They are so comfortable. They arrived quickly and were securely packaged. I would add a pic but they look exactly as pictured by the seller.
2,These earrings are beautiful!!  Took a bit of time to get them but worth it in the end.  Thanks much!!! Joules
2,"Love these earrings! I've never tried wearing ear climbers before, and they were so easy to put on. They look gorgeous."
2,These ear climbers are adorable and came exactly as pictured. I wasn’t sure if they would slip down but they stay out and look great on the ear! Shipping was fast. I’d definitely recommend!
2,"so many compliments on these, perfect size"

2,"Crazy long shipping, no fault of seller.  USPS is crazy right now. Cute earrings!"
2,They are beautiful and we love them!
2,"I love it, so beautiful to wear it everyday"
2,"We love these! I ordered a different set from another company and had to pay for each climber separately, so getting the set for the price paid made them both beautiful and affordable!"
2,"Cute! They came a little squished and I had to reshape them, and they lose their shape pretty easily when I sleep, but for the price I can deal with that!"
2,Great little ear-pins. Love 'em!
2,Very cute! The back of the earring is longer than I expected but I think it makes it better functioning to be honest. Highly recommend it’s a nice set of earrings :)
2,Very good quality. Unique!  I love them!
2,These are so adorable! I love them!
2,These star earrings are awesome!  I love the climbing look.
2,Just like the picture! I love them so much!

2,These are the cutest earrings!
2,I really love these earrings!
2,Fast shipping and arrived exactly as described and pictured. Would recommend this shop!

2,These are absolutely gorgeous earrings! Thank you !!!
2,"Super cute, glad I got these."
2,Super cute and really affordable!
2,It's beautiful my granddaughter loves it
2,These are so cute! Dainty but not so delicate that I feel like I am going to break them every time I put them in.
2,"These earrings are amazing, they fit my ears perfectly and sometimes, unlike with regular earrings, I don't even feel these on my ear! These are amazing thank you so much!"
2,Cute! As pictured/ described. The quick delivery is appreciated. It would be nice to have earring stops at the back to prevent slippage. Thanks!
2,"These are so cute, just what I wanted!"
2,Beautiful earrings! I love them!
2,"Cute 
Great for young girls"
2,"Shipped within a day and took a week to get to me which is pretty good for times like these. The earrings are so pretty and seem strong even though they look delicate. The only thing is, my ears are super sensitive and usually handle .925 sterling silver with no problem but these agitated my ears. I'd recommend buying these ear crawlers if you have sturdy ears but maybe shop elsewhere if you're prone to irritation."
2,I really want to give it a five but they keep falling down my earrings and the silver have chipped and I really really really love them. I'm just so disappointed with what happened to them. But I still love them and this has been my experience.
2,Good quality and good price. Will be back for more!
2,Good quality and good price. Will be back for more!

2,Even better in person 💙
2,"I’ve ordered from here before, and just like before, the earrings are beautiful! Thank you!"
2,Simple but beautiful! Fast shipping
2,"These are super cute.  I thought the stars might be too small, but they're perfect.   They are easy to wear and look adorable.   I'm only a little worried too much back and forth with the metal might break it, but so far they've been pretty durable; I've work them several times already."
2,Beautiful! Got compliments on them!
2,Really cute earrings and perfect for the 4th of July! Shipped super fast too :)
2,Teens loved the earrings I previously purchased. Came back to purchase different styles for their Easter baskets

2,Exactly like the photo! And very comfortable! Definitely would recommend
2,"It’s so cute..in theory. In practicality it ended up not fully formed out of the mold, one stud was jagged and snagged when trying to put into my ear. The stars aren’t as precisely cut, and I ended up taking a file to smooth out the edges & stud. They also don’t really stay in position, needing to be adjusted often. Again, really cute, so I’m working with them, but not as I was expecting."
2,They look great and timely delivery
2,These are so very cute...Love them!
2,Pretty and simple. I've gotten lots of compliments on them.
2,"Love them so much I bought a second pair as a gift for a friend -- she loves them, too!"
2,They are very cute. Dainty and sweet.
2,Both gifts were appreciated by their recipients!  Very swift shipping appreciated by me :)
2,Second purchase because I loved this so much!
2,"The earrings are beautiful and well made. They are not the easiest to put on for kids like my 10 yr old daughter but once on, stunningg"
2,Super cute! Took  2 weeks to get them so order ahead of time if they are a gift or you need them soon.

2,Very pretty - great present for my daughter
2,"Product took longer to ship than it should have, but it was out of the seller’s control due to Covid stuff. Seller was transparent and gave me the option to cancel the order,  which I declined because the earrings were exactly what I wanted. The seller shipped them out as soon as possible and they were received just a few days after Christmas. The seller went above and beyond to accommodate, even though the supply issues were out of her control. Would definitely buy from them again."
2,Turned green first time I worse it.
2,Gave as a gift and she loves them.
2,Came on time. Not overpriced.
2,Climbers arrived quickly and are super pretty!  Lots of compliments! ❤️
2,"Really cute and look great on.
Packaging was lovely and I can keep the box and use again.
Made of silver so don't iritate my ears
Occasionally fall down but I think that's just because of the earring type they are.
Would defo buy again from here! ❤"
2,"Fast service and delivery, elegant packaging and beautiful stylish product. I’m thrilled with the quality and design."

2,"I love these ear crawlers. I got the hammered silver and they are so cute. Very simple and unique. I get lots of compliments on them. I was worried that they would slide down, but I’ve had no issues."
2,"I love these SO much - I kind of bought them on a whim as I wasn't sure what they'd look like on, but I have literally worn them every day since I bought them. 
Simple , elegant but with a twist... I have already bought a pair for my friend ...."
2,"This is so pretty but it’s VERY tight and hurts if I wear it too long. I love it and I’m hoping I can get it to loosen a little over time.

Edit: evidently I don’t know anything about ear climbers! The seller reached out to me and recommended a way of loosening it and it’s PERFECT! I really appreciate that she took the time to help me and this was exactly what I was looking for!"
2,"Thank you MUKAstudio. Absolutely love my purchases. Super fast delivery, excellent quality. Definitely coming back for more."

2,Very painful to put on. Ear is very irritated after wearing
2,"I just adore everything about this cool ring. Awesome design, really beautiful tourmaline with so many shades of forest green. I love the vibes of this gorgeous ring... A million thanks to a very talented artist!"
2,Beautiful matching wedding rings. We love them! Perfect size after Rachel sent us a tool to find our size.
2,"La poésie de cette bague, la pureté douce de ce galet m'ont émue ! Quelle joie en la découvrant, je suis si fière de la porter ! Merci Rachel pour votre talent👍"

2,"Un peu déçue par le saphir que j'imaginais plus lumineux. Pas bien grave, le bracelet fait qd même son petit effet mais c'est la pierre par elle-même que je trouvais intéressante. Cela ne m'empêchera pas de faire d'autres achats ici."
2,"Les boucles sont très belles et de bonne qualité 
Merci"
2,"Exactly as described and pictured. The seller was prompt to respond to my questions, make the bracelet, and ship my order. I am very happy with the quality of the materials and craftsmanship. I love this bracelet that I had made to celebrate my son's birth."

2,"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
2,Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
2,"I saw this design in an Etsy promotional email, and I knew I had to have it! It's the first earring with a jacket that I had ever seen, and I love how delicate it looks. People say it looks like spikes, but it looks like a star with its beams of light to me. I love it so much. The earrings and the jacket are both well made and sturdy. Despite being based in Spain, they shipped quickly and arrived within a week!"
2,"These are beautiful earrings that give just enough interest to an outfit. I love wearing them with just regular tees or with casual dresses. I got them in gold and they perfectly complement my boyish pixie cut. 

Lalia quickly shipped my purchase the day after I ordered them, but because she's based in Spain, it took about a week and a half to get to the U.S. (just to give you a heads up). The earrings are well worth the wait though, I promise!!"
2,"They’re cute. However they are completely uneven, and do not fit each ear even remotely evenly. Also if you have sensitive skin beware, this material will give you complications if you have metal sensitivies. They also fall out a lot. But at least they’re cute!"
2,Love these earrings.  They are beautifully made and the ability to adjust them is genius to achieve the perfect fit.  This was my first purchase from this seller and I am so happy to have found this lovely shop!
2,"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
2,"These are just great, really original looking. Speedy shipping. Only downside is that they're fiddly as hell to put on, but that's not a flaw in these earrings, just what you get with this style! Would definitely purchase from here again."
2,Totally in love with the jewelry + fast delivery!
2,"I’m SO happy with these earrings! Dainty, yet edgy. Not too big. Great quality. Just awesome. I’ll be coming back to this seller again and again, thank you!!!"
2,I loved these💕😍
2,"It came exactly as described! I love it. My ears are very sensitive to different types of material and these earrings don't irritate them at all. Great customer service, shipped fast, beautiful earrings. Definitely 5 stars!"
2,Love these earrings! This was my 2nd time ordering and gifting family members who liked them after seeing me wear them. They LOVE them. This took an extremely long time to receive (due to COVID) but it was worth the wait.
2,"The wait was worth it! Blown away by the quality, Bylia! 100% will buy again."
2,"I bought this gift for my petite niece's 40th birthday. Before receiving them I was a little nervous about how well they would fit but there are three holes at the back of the earring which allow for some adjustment and this was not a problem. They arrived with me, in the U.K., from Spain, in 4 working days which was great. My niece was delighted to have such an usual pair of earrings. I thought them elegant, well made, high quality and, finally, nicely presented and I would recommend this item. I couldn't have asked for more, many thanks. Tina"
2,These are crazy wonderful! I just love them! Gives just that subtle edge.
2,I love this - it has three holes in the back so you can adjust to fit your lobe properly.  Beautiful earrings!

2,I was a bit upset when I first opened these earrings and they kept falling out of my ears. I would up putting on rubber stoppers behind the post and that worked like a charm. I’ve gotten a few compliments and I really like them!
2,I absolutely LOVE these earrings! They are amazing!
2,I love these earrings. They are so cute !
2,Absolutely Beautiful! Thankyou

2,Sooooo tolle verrückte Ohrstecker. Hat nicht jeder. 😉 Tolle Verarbeitung und Qualität. Lieben Dank! 💐
2,"Beautiful and dainty spiked ear jacket, just as pictured. I appreciate the gold plating which prevents allergic reaction with base metals. I looked elsewhere for the same design, but this was the best price by far. Thank you!"
2,They arrived really quickly and I just love them. It's good that they're adjustable and you can wear it as an ear jacket or just the stud on its own. So pretty
2,These earrings are simple yet stunning! They were exactly what I was hoping for.

2,"Super cute & appears to be good quality. Since I live in the U.S., I did not get updated shipping information once the product left Spain, so there was a gap of >2 weeks when I got no updated tracking information, but the shop owner was very responsive, & I did receive the product as promised. Would buy again!"
2,"Love these ear jackets! They are look delicate and are very well made. Also, great communication with the shop throughout the purchase process. Earrings also came in beautiful packaging. Would be excellent as a gift or for yourself!"

2,"Beautiful earrings, they come well presented and I am happy with the purchase. My only complaint is that after wearing them they started to change colour (the park that goes inside the piercing) and so it made my ears a bit itchy. I have sensitive skin."
2,Bought as a gift for a friend. Arrived promptly and was just as pictured. My friend loved it!
2,"lovely earrings, verry happy with them!"

2,"Great earrings, thank you :)"
2,Nice pair of earrings. Thanks
2,I haven’t gotten this item in the mail yet it’s been almost a month
2,"This seemed to take a long time to arrive, but it did arrive toward the end of the time frame given. The clasp of one earring did not stay on and the 3 pieces fell apart easily. After several communications and sending requested pictures of the earring, the seller did identify the problem and outline a way for me to fix it. Seller always replied to my comments within 1 business day. However, it was frustrating to have to go through a ""fix it"" process at all."
2,They are SO cute! I got my husband’s initials and they are so well made and I am beyond happy with my purchase! 💗
2,I absolutely love my earrings!  I love that my twinkies’ first name initials will always be with me 💙❤️

2,Just perfect for my daughter!
2,"These are SO cute and so simply great! 
I ordered a set for my furrbabies names, loved them and then came back and ordered sets for gifts. 
So great!  I recommend taking the earrings out at night before sleep or before pulling a hoodie over your head."
2,I love all these earrings so much! The posts are very delicate though and one was bent on receiving. Still functioning though. I’d definitely purchase more from this shop
2,Really cute! Fast shipping! Loved that I didn’t have to order the two letters separately.
2,These are beautiful. Shipped so quickly. Such an easy transaction.  Got a pair for my daughter with her two daughters initials as a Covid cheer up gift :-) and she loved them so much I ordered a pair for a new mom with her two children’s  initials! So good.
2,love them! super cute and they came so fast!!
2,Super cute and great quality. Everything shipped right away too! Only wish my “t” and “l” would have been a little bigger or in capital form.
2,Dainty and lovely! Happy with my purchase!
2,"These earrings are so cute and they seem fairly sturdy. I was a bit hesitant that they would be super thin for the price but I am very pleased with them. They were shipped and delivered very quickly too, thank you!  I will be back for another set !"

2,Beautiful earrings and super quick delivery.
2,fast shipping and quick response!
2,"Just received these and I have to say they're really nice. BUT, with that being said, the part that goes through the ear hole is very flimsy. Tried to put the backing through for the first time and it bent already. Not sure if it will hold up. Wish it was made of stronger material."
2,Just what I wanted - these are great!  Thank you
2,Product was just what i wanted and came pretty fast

2,Earrings shipped quickly & are exactly what I was looking for.
2,Ordered an L.  It looks like maybe a J or a cursive L with a chunk out of it.  They refuned my money becauseI wasn't happy. The other letters were perfect.  Will order from them again
2,Fast shipping and great product!
2,"These earrings hurt my ears.... I've never been sensitive to jewelry, especially genuine silver and gold, but there's something in the material of these that isn't just silver or gold."
2,Super sweet earrings. Bought them as a gift and the person looooved them!
2,LOVE! getting more for gifts!
2,"Super cute, great gift idea"
2,Item was exactly what I was looking for. Shipped quickly.
2,"I LOVE this ear cuff. 😍 It is absolutely stunning and easily the most beautiful piece of jewelry I own. Plus, the sizing and dimensions were just right for my ear. There’s a post for pierced ears on the bottom and a wrap around clamp for the cartilage on top. I wore this as a part of a “queen” costume at an event where I was dancing all night and the cuff stayed on really well... which is saying a lot cause I really move my head around when I dance. It did get a bit painful on the top, especially when it got brushed while hugging people, but the clamp is adjustable, so loosening it did help a bit. It’s so beautiful, though, that it was worth any discomfort. Also, I paid for 1-3 day shipping and it did take a week to come to the States, so just be sure to plan accordingly. It’s worth the wait!"
2,"Absolutely LOVE the cuff. It fits perfectly and stays in place. Customs were rediculously expensive though, but it's still a really beautiful ear accessory!"
2,"Vraiment déçue et choquée par la qualité du produit étant donné son prix. 
Sans oublier que le facteur à ma porte m’a facturé 47€ de “frais de douane” alors qu’ils ne sont mentionnés nulle part dans l’annonce!!!
Attention, ne vous faites pas avoir!!!!"
2,Beautiful craftsmanship! Simple and elegant. I’m very happy with this piece!
2,Absolutely gorgeous earrings. I love that there's an adjustable clasp at the top portion to keep the earrings in place! The only drawback is that they took a little less than a month to arrive (overseas shipping).
2,Very beautiful ear climber and matching stud. Fantastic quality. Would absolutely buy again.
2,So beautiful.. 😍..I will rate the seller 10/10..A+++
2,Love them! The perfect pretty show stoppers for my sister's wedding.
2,I am so happy with these earrings. I’ll be wearing these on my wedding day and can’t wait to show them off! Thank you!
2,Love these earrings!  Will add some unique sparkle to different outfits.
2,En attente de commande! C’est un scandale
2,Very beautiful piece. I’m very excited to wear it in Palm Springs!
2,"I ordered these in rose gold and then messaged the shop on the same day of purchase to see if I could actually request the same ones in silver instead. The shop owner confirmed that this was possible and asked me to provide a link to the color I wanted, which I did.

I ordered them at the end of December for an event on February 1st. They just arrived and they’re beautiful but they’re rose gold instead of silver. Because the shipping took so long, I won’t be able to have this corrected in time for my event. My fault for changing the color but I am bummed that the shop owner wasn’t able to make the correction after confirming."
2,"Thank You for changing my order for me , I really appreciate it. The ear crawlers are really pretty!"
2,"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fiancé’s wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It’s so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
2,I can’t stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it’s one of the prettiest rings I’ve ever seen. My fiancé is very proud of it and I’m a very happy fiancée. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
2,"This ring looks so amazing! I’ve never seen a prettier ring, and my now fiancée absolutely loves it! The picture doesn’t do it justice. It looks so much better in person. I could not be happier about my purchase."
2,"Words can’t even describe how impressed I was! At first I was skeptical ordering a ring without seeing it in person. However I’m so glad I did! Lena was amazing throughout the whole process! My boyfriend and I picked out this ring together as my engagement ring, but has not yet proposed, so waiting to officially wear it! Highly recommend this shop! They were very flexible with payments and doing custom sizing. Couldn’t have had a better experience!"
2,"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here’s what my (now) fiancée had to say:

“This ring is everything I’ve ever wanted. It’s perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven’t had it on a full 24 hours and can’t even count how many people have said ‘that is by far the most beautiful ring I’ve ever seen.’”"
2,"Love love love love love. The top photo shows the contrast in direct sunlight, and the bottom is inside. Depending on the lighting the grey will be more pronounced. (The colors seen in the bottom photo are from a stained glass window reflecting nearby!) I absolutely love this ring and am so glad we chose to order from Lena. She answered any and every question I had and the ring took only 3 days to arrive once shipped. After spending weeks looking for a salt and pepper diamond, I was thrilled to come across this listing. If you are even considering a salt and pepper diamond, do not hesitate to inquire about this beauty!"
2,"From the fiancé:
 
I found Lena on Etsy several years ago while browsing for jewelry, and instantly fell in love with her beautiful rings. Even before dating my now-fiancé, I dreamily “favorited” this emerald engagement ring, thinking that someday I’d be engaged to the love of my life with this ring on my finger. I can’t believe that day has finally come! It is even more beautiful in-person and I couldn’t be happier with Lena’s craftsmanship! Most importantly, the ring has special significance to me knowing that it was handmade in Israel where I was born, spent the first five years of my life, and still visit to see family. Thank you, Lena, for being a part of this memorable time in our lives!"
2,"I couldn’t be happier with my rings! Lena worked so hard to make sure my wedding band fit perfectly with my engagement ring - and was extremely prompt and easy to communicate with. She is so genuinely kind and went above and beyond in ensuring that I was completely thrilled with my rings. Our wedding day was perfection!! Lena is creative, sweet, and thoughtful! I love my rings!"
2,"Lena from sevencaratshop was incredibly helpful in helping me acquire this ring for my now fiancée. All of her jewelry looks great and is easy to find on her Etsy page. She had it sized and shipped halfway across the world in minimal time, I was able to propose much earlier than anticipated. The quality of the diamond is pristine, such an exquisite cut I even find myself taking closer looks at it! Of course she said yes, and now the only thing shining brighter than the ring is my gorgeous fiancées smile. She loves showing it off and it’s all thanks to Lena at sevencaratshop! I will be a repeat customer in the future for sure!"
2,"The whole process of selecting a ring, custom designing it, delivering etc. has been amazing with Lena. The ring itself is stunning and I could not be happier with it. My partner is in love with it, she thinks that it is the perfect ring. She has compliments everywhere we go.
I cannot speak highly enough of Lena's customer service, despite being nervous about ordering online I felt I had better customer service than buying from a shop. I would 100% to recommend SevenCaratShop to anyone looking for beautiful unique jewelry. 
Thank you Lena, you have been amazing!"
2,"I received my diamond ring and I was absolutely delighted with the quality and workmanship! I tried to capture its brilliance in the photo, the diamond is stunning! I am very pleased, and so is my husband! I will not hesitate to purchase again from Lena!"
2,Lena is great to work with! She created a custom order so I could have a wedding ring that fit perfectly with my engagement ring!
2,"From the fiancée- It's absolutely gorgeous! It took about two weeks to ship, and then it arrived within 4 days. It fits perfectly and the stones are exactly what I wanted. My fiancé proposed at the zoo, and the polar bear came up to admire the ring immediately. We also got some wonderful photos of the sea lions swimming by to take a peek! I'm so happy with this ring, I can't stop staring at it and I'm so happy we went with Lena! Thank you for creating such a beautiful engagement ring that I'll wear and cherish forever!"
2,"Absolutely beautiful ring! I was very apprehensive about buying without seeing but Lena was very communicative and I’d read all the reviews beforehand. It’s so stunning! The halo ring means a lot to me as I sadly lost my Dad in May and I wanted something beautiful to look at every day that reminds me of my lovely,  shining star. Thank you Lena x"
2,Absolutely beautiful ring! Can’t stop staring at it and constantly get compliments on it. Would Never go to another jeweler. She takes excellent care with my jewelry and goes out of her way to make sure it’s perfect!
2,"I couldn’t be happier with the custom set that Lena built for me! Pictures don’t do it justice, it is so beautiful and I couldn’t be more in love with it! Lena was amazing to work with and made the process of purchasing something so important and an international purchase a little less intimidating. She really did everything she could to ease any anxiety about such a big purchase that I was never able to see in person until it arrived. Thank you so much!"
2,"Really nice piece. Fast shipment. Very nice people to do business with. Lena really went above and beyond my expectations of customer service. 

Only thing, I wish I would have realized the size. It appears larger than it is in the photo, but my mistake, as the size is listed in the description. I have attached a photo. Wish I had a better photo to send, but I'm behind on posting a review as I received this more than a months ago. The chain in the photo is my own. It was not purchased with the pendant. 

Moving forward, I can overlook the size, as it really is a beautiful piece that attracts a lot of compliments. Thank you Lena for your awesome customer service!!  👌🏼😘"
2,I just received my rings! I was pretty nervous ordering such a high dollar item on the internet but I will buy all of my jewelry from Lena at SevenCarat! The rings are absolutely stunning and everything I had hoped!
2,"Lena made a beautiful ring! It is exactly what I hoped. Everyone thinks it's quite beautiful and elegant. The experience of her helping design it was quite easy, and I got exactly what I wanted! Thanks!"
2,I love this ring and so does my Fiancé. The fact it is hand made and the diamonds are not conflict stones really appealed to me. The design looks really elegant. The customer service was outstanding. They even allowed me to make payments on the ring. They're awesome thank you guys
2,"She said YES to her dream ring! She loves it, thank you!!"
2,Beautiful pair of diamond earrings.  I love them.  Thank you so much ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
2,"I can,t speak highly enough of Lena,s personal level of service and communication. Absolutely beautiful earrings, couldn,t be happier!"
2,"So impressed with this ring, and most importantly, so was my (now) fiance! The ring absolutely stuns, totally sparkles in the light. The small diamonds are perfect, as is the main diamond.

Diamond has no visible inclusions, and the price was such a tremendous value.

Lena contacted me within hours of setting up the order, got the ring in roughly 10 days which was fantastic!

Could not be happier, thank you so much!"
2,I got this as a gift to myself and I absolutely love it! I get compliments all the time. I'm not a good enough photographer to show how beautiful this is. If I ever want to splurge on me again I know where to go.
2,Love the detailing. Don't care for how they sit in the ear. Delivery was great.
2,"I was immensely impressed with Lena's craftsmanship. The ring was exactly what I wanted. 

I was having so much trouble finding something that met my budget and also spoke to me. 

I even had a crazy delivery deadline and Lena did everything in her power to get my order all the way to Canada in time for my flight to San Francisco to ask my girlfriend to marry to me. 

(She said yes, by the way).

Blown away by Lena's customer service and artistry. Could not have asked for more.

Thank you so very much.

-Carolyn from Canada :)"
2,"Its more beautiful in reality than the picture, can't be more happier with service and the product, my wife felt like queen today, I awfully thank you."
2,"After much searching, my fiancée and I were glad to find Lena's Sevencaratshop. Lena's designs are beautiful, elegant and timeless. 

Lena went to considerable lengths to make sure my fiancée was happy with the gold diamond engagement ring I purchased, demonstrating great care not only in her craftsmanship but also for her customer's satisfaction. 

Thanks, Lena, for helping to make our engagement a pleasant one. We greatly appreciate you and your work!"
2,Love my ring! Lena was so easy to work with and had great communication. Highly recommended!
2,"The garnet stud earrings set in 14K white gold were gorgeous! The stones were superior quality, very deeply colored and clear. The goldwork was truly professional.
The gift box was beautiful and so was the luxe gift bag.
Delivery was swift, and secure (I had to sign for the package). 
I loved the idea that these earrings were handmade and not mass produced. That made them extra special.
Most of all, my daughter LOVED them!
I would recommend Lena at SevenKarat without hesitation.
Thank you very much, Lena! 💖💖💖"
2,First I was uncertain to order a diamond ring online. I was scared to get scammed. But now Im so glad to trusted Lena. The ring is even more beautiful life. Lena was always answering me fast. I can remmonded everyone who isn´t sure to buy a ring online. And the price/performance ratio is great. Thank you so much Lena!!!
2,"Very fast shipping considering the ring came from Israel. I liked that the seller used Fedex vs the postal service.

The ring is gorgeous! It has incredible sparkle! It is difficult to believe this ring is just 1 carat as it looks like a 3 carat ring. I also like that the band of the ring gets slightly wider in the back. I’m very happy with my purchase! I’m wearing it as an anniversary ring."
2,"After reviewing the various engagement rings available on Etsy, I stumbled across Lena's 1 ct diamond engagement ring with my partner (now fiancée) and we both instantly impressed at how beautiful it looked after reading the description and viewing the photos available online!  After contacting Lena for guidance on how to arrange a payment plan, she responded back straight away and was an absolute pleasure to deal with the whole way through the process right up until the ring was shipped out to me in Australia and arrived safely and securely in an extremely quick turnaround of 3 business days. I was absolutely thrilled with the ring when it arrived, it truly does look amazing, and due to the excellent service I received from Lena, my fiancée has now decided to purchase my engagement ring online from Sevencaratshop too!"
2,Lena was a pleasure to work with and the rings are simply stunning. The design is so unique and intricate. Thank you so much for my fiancé’s dream ring!
2,"This ring set is absolutely beautiful. It adds an incredible sparkle to the finger, and is sure to pick up compliments from strangers. Pictures can't do it justice! Not to mention Lena was so helpful throughout the shipping process!"
2,This ring is even more beautiful than pictured. Love my new ring.
2,An absolutely beautiful engagement ring. My partner adores it. The diamond catches the light beautifully and it’s all round a gorgeous ring.
2,"Really pretty emerald ring. Lena was super helpful and was very diligent in finding the right emerald for me. I love working with her in all my purchases :) 
Thank you Lena!"
2,Nothing but great things to say. Item arrived earlier than expected and packaged very well. Leading up to the purchase I had many questions that were answered timely. I needed a custom size and with a quick message we got everything set up. This was a wonderful experience.
2,"It is absolutely beautiful! Thank you so much for your amazing work!
Wonderful customer service! The seller is very helpful and shipping was quick. Highly recommended."
2,My girlfriend loved it!  Everything went very well—from delivery to customer service
2,This .30 carat diamond solitaire pendant is very beautiful. The diamond is just what it should be....brilliant. The seller was a delight to work with.  I highly recommend this shop
2,"Really pretty emerald ring. Lena was super helpful and was very diligent in finding the right emerald for me. I love working with her in all my purchases :) 
Thank you Lena!"
2,"We bought these for my mom for Christmas. She LOVES them. Everyone compliments how beautiful and delicate they look. However, they are not delicate at all. They are well made and lock into place when the backing is on correctly. She loves that they are handmade from Israel. Lena got them to us quickly. I am so pleased with them and this shop will be an Etsy favorite now."
2,Ring was even better than I expected! Lena did a wonderful job! Item was shipped quickly and Lena did a great job with communication! Thank you!!
2,What a beautiful ring!!  The sapphire and diamonds are clear and clean!!  My ring and matching halo earrings sparkle in the light!  Lena was a dream to work with!  Highly recommend!
2,Lena was one of the best sellers i've ever encountered. She went above and beyond to make sure that I had exactly what I wanted with the this ring. Would defo recommend! Thanks Lena!
2,"Excellent experience! Lena was so helpful and patient while answering all my questions. The ruby earrings are absolutely stunning! My sister-in-law was touched by our efforts to matched her mother’s ring. (Whited out in pic) Packaged in a stylish box and gift bag, it arrived ready to gift! Shipping was very quick and the tracking provided was accurate. Definitely will be back for another purchase."
2,My fiance loves the ring! The design is great.
2,"This is the prettiest ring!  The stones are sparkly, the design is lovely and I will be back to find something else!  It looks exactly like its picture."
2,Thank you so much! This is a beautiful ring - I love it! It looks better in person than I expected from the photos. Fast delivery and lovely packing. I’m very happy!
2,"Lena was awesome to deal with. The ring is very sparkly and the carat weight was actually a bit higher than expected. 

It was slightly cloudier than expected which is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5. 

Everyone has been a huge fan of it, though! Very happy with my purchase and my new wife loves it. It's a very cool looking ring, that is absurdly sparkly in the light."
2,"Lena was great help easy to chat to and super helpful with any questions i had. Super nice lady. Im very happy with all her service and the ring stunning.
I would highly recommend Lena and her shop to anybody looking to by a engagement ring as a guy, her help superb"

2,This ring is the most beautiful piece of jewelry I’ve ever owned. Thank you Lena for such a wonderful treasure! It will be worn forever and passed down to my daughter one day. It is truly priceless ❤️
2,"These earrings did not match the Etsy photograph, which showed nearly transparent emeralds, while those delivered were translucent at best or even opaque."
2,"UTTERLY EXQUISITE.  Shipped promptly and quickly, is exactly as ordered, a truly beautiful and delicate little piece.  Highly recc. both the item and the seller!"
2,Lena was great with getting back to me quickly and answering all of my questions. And her work is great! Highly recommend!

2,"The pendant was beautifully made, the emerald stone although lab created was a ideal choice as I wanted it to catch the attention of the people when they glanced at the necklace..

2,The earrings arrived and are perfect!

2,Gorgeous!!!! The pictures did them justice and they're perfect for my wedding!!
2,I was very pleased with how it looks I love them         They came in record time I would definitely recommend them to anyone
2,I love my new ear climbers.  They are beautiful.  And the way they were packaged made them even more special!  You have definitely won my business.  💙
2,These are beautiful and versatile. I have received a lot of complements and the stones have a more pronounced effect than just metal earrings. One of the earring tip was sharp and I contacted the seller who was gracious and swift to replace the earring. It is a little difficult putting in because my piercing is small. I recommend the rubber backs which help them to secure in place. I wear them as climbers and also down.
2,"So gorgeous!!! Feminine and sparkly!!!    The photo does not do it justice - Just lovely!!!
 I have bought things before - and I am never disappointed!!!   Even the detail in the wrapping - that is a gift in itself!!! Thank you so much!!!!"
2,"Got my order on time and as described, l love them. Highly recommend!"
2,I love these!! They will be perfect for my wedding. They are made well and good quality and fit great. I don't think they'll slide down.
2,Very pretty earrings. I was a bit skeptical about how they would fit because my ears are very small and I have tunnels in my first hole i put them in my third hole and they are perfect. Nice and dainty!
2,Ordered both the rose and white gold! Beaustifully pacakaged 😍 Looks even better in person!! Great ear crawlers; shiny!!
2,The earrings I bought looked exactly like the picture and are beautiful! Seller was quick to answer my question and I got my order quick!
2,"I love these crawlers! They arrived within a week, and Iam very happy, and satisfied with my order. No regrets"
2,So cute!! Got a lot of compliments! Easy to put in too and great quality!!
2,Got the rose gold climbers and they are beautiful! Sparkly and eye-catching but also quite elegant.
2,These are even more beautiful in person! Nice quality also!!
2,Obsessed with these! So pretty and sparkly! Thank you so much!
2,love these. so pretty and easy to wear. first pair I have had.

2,Nice
2,Beautiful ear bling!  I'm really impressed by the quality of the items I received.  Thank you so much!
2,Beautiful and came exactly as described!
2,Love the earrings! Bought 10 pairs for my bridesmaids.  Now I wish I would have purchased a pair for myself as well!
2,These are perfect! I can't wait to wear for my wedding and even better that they're hypoallergenic.
2,Bit pricey for what I received. But overall happy
2,"Loved the design but unfortunately I was allergic to the material. Great seller, very fast response. Thank you!"
2,"Gave them as a gift , she loved it!!!"
2,Loveeeee these! They look sophisticated but a bit edgy.
2,Very nice loved this item
2,"Very pretty item, delicate and unique"
2,"Very beautiful, if you have sensitive ears they will make your lobes itch a little."
2,Beautiful! Prompt shipping & excellent merchandise!
2,Beautiful item and received it so quickly!
2,"Beautiful earrings 
I got the white gold"
2,Arrived on time. Nice packaging.
2,"they look exactly like the pictures, good quality"
2,. . . . . . . . .  . . . . . .
2,"Beautiful earrings. Although the earrings are as expected and pretty, unfortunately, they won't stay up so they keep dangling down. Guess my ear shape just isn't made for earring cuffs/crawlers. Beautiful just not for me."
2,Bought a pair for myself and had to go back and buy a pair for my friend. Lovely earrings.
2,Beautiful but unfortunately the first time I wore them I lost one within an hour :-(
2,"Shipping on time. Cute packaging. Nothing really special about the item. The part that bugged me was that it moved a lot on my ear.. it is a little pliable so you can form it around your ear lobe, but it never stays. At the end of the day, it just ends up dangling vertically off of my ear."
2,They are pretty junky & cheap looking.  Not even going waste the postage to send them back.
2,"I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn´t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I´ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I´ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!"
2,"These are beautiful, quality, and hand crafted. I love them. They are stunning and unique. Very excited for my wedding day. My only recommendation for the shop owner is to post a photo of the back of the earring. I did not realize it had a stud and a clip on section (makes sense given its design; very practical!). I also like that I can adjust the strength of the clip on part. They are a bit heavier than you might expect, so if you have sensitive ears, you might want to go a bit smaller."
2,"These were purchased for my wedding day and were absolutely everything I dreamed of. Beautiful earrings, high quality, photographed incredibly. Thank you!"
2,Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.
2,"I wore these earrings for my wedding and received so many compliments.  They went with my dress perfectly! 

Ilona was so great to work with, especially since I broke one of the earrings a week before the wedding and she sent a replacement through FedEx as fast as she possibly could! I also loved that she was able to add a clasp to the back of the earrings to make them stay a little better - this ended up working out perfectly.  I'm so glad I read someone else's review who advised they did this as well.  I ordered all of my bridesmaids earrings through Ilona as well and all of them loved the earrings.  Each pair also came with an extra set of backs, a zippered bag, and a little card that said then you for being my bridesmaid - I really appreciated these  details! I wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again."
2,Yasss. I love them. So cute. Packaging adorable!
2,I was so happy with the pieces I bought and got so many compliments throughout my wedding! Great communication with shop owner and worked with me to expedite my order so I had it for my wedding day!!
2,Absolutely gorgeous. She is so helpful and sent me earrings with boxes and bags. These are even more beautiful in person since she uses really great quality stones
2,Amazing amazing earrings! Got them for my wedding and got so many compliments! Different from anything I saw at any other store and super easy to wear.
2,"I love these earrings! They are gorgeous and unique and sooo sparkly! They fit perfectly, I can’t wait to wear them on my wedding day! These earrings have the clamp on the back for the upper part of the earlobe so if your ears are small or not shaped right these might not fit great. Fast shipping and they were exactly as described. Thank you Iloniti!"
2,Absolutely loved my earrings!  Shop owner helped me to pick out a pair that would fit my dress and look best.  Sent in a timely manor and wrapped in a beautiful little box.  Totally recommend!!
2,"These earrings are GORGEOUS!!!  I had trouble with the top part slipping down, but Ilona was able to fashion a pair with clips for me.  The clips hold the earrings perfectly in place, so I don't have to worry about them sliding on my wedding day.  These are the most gorgeous, sparkly earrings and will be perfect for my big day.  Ilona was fantastic to work with, too!"
2,"I looked for weeks for the perfect set of earrings for my wedding day and stumbled upon these, they were absolutely perfect and I still love wearing them for other special occasions. I feel like they looked great in all the pictures, they are gorgeous! I bought a matching necklace for my maid of honor as well."
2,Gorgeous earrings just like the photos provided ! Shipping was super speedy and can't wait to wear these sparkly beauty's for my wedding day !
2,I absolutely love these. They are even more stunning in person and perfect to complete my wedding day look!
2,"These earrings made it to corsica and impressed everyone! Gorgeous elegant but discrete, they were just perfect! Great customer service on top!"
2,"I purchased these earrings for my wedding in the Fall and they are beautiful, although I felt like they were too big for my earlobes and didn't fit as well as I would like. I expressed this to the owner and she offered to send me another pair of my choice at no cost. I can tell that she really cares about her customers. I found a new pair of earrings and am so excited to wear them for my wedding!"
2,"LOVE LOVE LOVE! Perfect fit, dainty enough. But still a SHOWSTOPPER! I highly recommend this shop. 👍🏽👍🏽"
2,"Great communication and great quality, looked absolutely beautiful on my wedding day."
2,I ordered these earrings and received them within a week! The packaging was to die for and the quality of the earrings is phenomenal. I cannot wait to wear them on my wedding day in December!
2,"These earings are beautiful! I love the way they give a sparkle covering your earlobe. They are for pierced ears but have an extra attachment similar to clip ones earings. It secures the earring to the edge of the ear to keep them in place.  Comfortable and BEAUTIFUL!
Great customer service as I exchanged them for white gold to match my wedding dress!"
2,These earrings are beautiful!! Perfect for my wedding day!!
2,I can't express my love for these earrings and this shop enough! Iloniti was an amazing communicator and these earrings are perfect and so so so beautiful!
2,"Gorgeous! They are small and simple, yet eye catching and so elegant. They look just like they do in the picture. Came wrapped perfectly."
2,"Quick shipping, great customer service, earrings were beautiful and as expected. The part that clips the top to your ear lobe is adjustable - if it's too tight it pulls back and looks weird, but if it's too loose it will drop down while you're wearing them, it took me a little bit to get them adjusted perfectly, but after that they stayed up, looked beautiful, and were not uncomfortable at all! :-)"
2,Gorgeous! The seller was gracious to create my vision by adding a few white opals into the design. i would definitely purchase from this shop again.
2,"Shipped very quickly, high quality.  Excellent packaging.  Even came with extra backs for the earrings which is great because I'm always losing the backs!  I'm so excited to wear these on my wedding day, thank you!"
2,"These are great!  Exactly like the photos!  I do wish there had been a picture of the back of the earrings.  What you don't know is there is a twist clasp (probably not the right term for it) at the very top and I assume this is to help keep the earrings on up top b/c they are quite heavy but I've been struggling to twist that on and to get them on properly.  However, I'm not too worried about it and I'm sure it'll work out on the wedding day.  :)"
2,Love the way it looks with my engagement ring!
2,I bought these earrings for my wedding! I love the way the crystals are arranged. They have a beautiful sparkle to them! I have multiple piercings on my earlobes - but this earring covers up the rest of the holes! They have an adjustable screw that helps keep the earring on your ear without pinching it! Can’t wait to show them off!
2,This picture doesn’t do these gorgeous earrings justice. I have a small earlobe so I appreciate the added clasp that is adjustable. Packaging and delivery beyond my expectations. Overall exceptional experience. I will definitely buy from her again.
2,These earrings are gorgeous!  They are high-quality and have a small adjustable clamp to hold the climbers to your ear without worrying about them moving at all.  Love love love!
2,These are so beauttiful and they were delivered very fast to Vancouver Canada. Can't wait to wear them on my wedding day
2,"Love these earrings! They're beautiful and fit well. Really fun, and the perfect complement to my simple wedding gown."
2,Got these for my wedding.  I love them.  They catch the light and shine so beautifully!
2,Perfect! Add opals to match my wedding sash.
2,Ces boucles sont tout simplement superbes ! Je ne regrette pas du tout cet achat. L'emballage était vraiment très soigné. Tout était vraiment PARFAIT !
2,"Excellent quality, very well constructed. The earring has a post and earring back like most earrings then has a clamp that clamps onto the middle of your ear to achieve the 'crawler' look. I wasn't sure when I ordered how this was going to work and I was very pleased with how it was put together. Can't wait to wear these for our wedding!"
2,"These are even more beautiful in person 😍 Can't wait to wear them on my wedding day!! Will definitely be ordering more, Thank you!"
2,"Absolutely stunning and much lighter than I was expecting which is fantastic. Great quality, seems nice and sturdy. Sparkly, glamorous and nicely packaged. My only concern (and this would be a personal preference which is why I'm keeping it at 5 stars) is the clasp for the upper part of the earring that climbs, I think wearing them for long periods of time may cause discomfort to some."
2,"Package, timing and delivery was absolutely amazing!! The earring are even better & exactly what I wanted. Thank you so much for being amazing!!!"
2,Amazing jewellery!!!!!
2,Really beautiful and unique! They don't sit as flush to the ear as in the picture but I was already expecting that from past reviews. Planning on just using a little bit of facial glue to have them sit the way I want. Can't wait to wear them for my wedding! Thank you!
2,I would absolutely order from the owner of the shop again and again! She was unbelievably sweet and with outstanding costumer service. The wrong earrings were accidentally put into my order and she fixed it before I even got the package. Beautiful jewelry and I seriously can't wait to wear it for my wedding day!
2,Absolutely beautiful! I was so surprised at how much more beautiful it was in person. It arrived very quick and I could not be more excited to have purchased this for my wedding.
2,Omg! I absolutely LOVE my new earrings! I cannot wait to wear them for my wedding ❤️
2,These earrings are gorgeous! Even more so in person. And great customer service. Highly recommend!
2,Gorgeous! Better than expected! I am so excited to wear them on my wedding day.
2,gorgeous!!
2,"The earrings are beautiful and are exactly how they are pictured on here!  I might need to get different backs, as you can see the backs because my ears are so small.

2,earrings are beautiful! can't wait to wear them for my wedding day.
2,Beautiful and unique!! Can't wait to wear them on my wedding day!
2,Pretty earrings. Sit a bit further back on my earlobe than the picture displayed. The cuff has a screw attachment to secure to upper ear which can be seen from the back. Pricey for what your receive.
2,"I bought these earrings for my wedding and I absolutely LOVED them. They look and feel high quality, and they looked beautiful at the wedding. 

My only small issue was that the clasp on the upper part of the earring was not angled in a way that easily fit my ears. I’m not sure if it’s just my ear shape, but I had to have help getting the earrings on. However, they did still fit, they stayed on all day, they looked beautiful, and I wouldn’t change earrings if I had the chance! And to be fair to the shop, I didn’t try these on ahead of time (my fault) so I did not get the chance to discuss this with the shop or get it corrected."
2,"These remind me of my mothers jewelry from the 50's. Lots of sparkle, lots of fun!"
2,Exactly as pictured! Thank you! So pretty!

2,"very odd earrings... they are for pierced ears but there also is a slip-on part? idk.... 

The earrings are beautiful though!"
2,"Unfortuantely, other reviews were accurate. These earrings are so large and heavy that they pulled away from my ears, adn looked very odd. I was not happy with them, but Ilona was very helpful throughout the return process."
2,Nice earnings for wedding. Priced a bit high for the quality but wear well.
2,Didn’t fit my small ears but very pretty and nice quality.
2,"I was shocked by how sparkly these earrings are. The pictures don’t do them justice. So beautiful and perfect for my wedding. They are comfortable and light weight (which was important to me because I don’t wear earrings very often). 

The seller was so kind and quick to respond when I had a question about the shipping. She helped to track my package which I sincerely appreciated. The earrings only arrived 2 days outside of the estimated delivery window which she warned me from the start may happen due to world-wide COVID-19 delays. Overall very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend."
2,"I loved my earrings! They were a perfect match to my dress and got many compliments! They were also very unique and I was pleased with the order and even happier they came from Israel, my homeland. Thank you Dana for such beautiful jewelry! She was also very quick to answer and super responsive. Highly recommend!"
2,"Absolutely love these earrings! I was hesitant to purchase them at first because they’re a bit pricey, but I looked everywhere and kept coming back to this design. Simple yet unique and elegant with great shine! Not too clunky - exactly what I was looking for! Shipped and delivered super fast!"
2,Loveeee them!!!
2,"These are exactly as pictured and turned out perfect! I plan on wearing these for my wedding in September and they are the perfect size and sparkle. I love the cluster and jacket style of this earring. I found a lot of others I liked on Etsy, but all of them were too big, too ornate, and would take away from the rest of me. These, are gorgeous!! I am so excited to wear these on my wedding day. Thank you!"
2,"Gorgeous! 

I was so excited to see these earnings for my wedding day. They are adjustable which is very nice and they look just like the photo.

Thank you for the prompt delivery and beautifully designed earrings ! 
LOVE THEM!"
2,"Truly beautiful earrings. I saw the photos on this post and wondered if the earrings would look the same on...and I can confirm, they do! They are also excellent quality and clarity. There are 3 different height settings to adjust the ear jacket to your ear size. I wore these for my wedding and highly recommend!"
2,The earrings are beautiful. Absolutely perfect. Great customer service.Dana was very responsive and great to work with. Highly recommend.
2,The loveliest shop owner! Dana was so kind and helpful! We managed to surprise a bride to be with these stunning earrings for her wedding day! Highly recommend and would shop again! x

2,So stunning love the modern look
2,Dana dispatched these earrings so quickly and they arrived beautifully packaged. I was worried the studs would be too small for my ear (I used to have one stretched) but thankfully there's no issue and they look beautiful! Perfect for my wedding

The communication with the shop was brilliant. (they made me aware that there were holidays that could extend the delivery dates) Thanks"

2,"As pictured.  A bit difficult to put on and get right, but it doesn't detract from the look."
2,"Absolutely LOVE these! So unique :D Had some compliments on them too. 
I also suffer with allergies to nickel, chrome and gold and these are fine because they are as they say, silver 
Great service, thank you!"
2,"I bought this as a gift and it is beautiful, and the packaging is so cute! Vera was very helpful and kind - I'll definitely be buying from her again!"
2,Love these! I like how you have the option of just using the studs as well.
2,"My ears have always been really sensitive to metals and these earrings are not only BEAUTIFUL, but they're treating my ding dang sensitive-as-heck ears very well. I love this simple, elegant design and I'm going to buy more pairs. Thank you!"
2,Earrings are gorgeous but I should have paid attention to the shop location as the postage and the customs duty cost more than the Earrings. Nevertheless they will make the recipient very happy
2,These are elegant. The item arrived as promised
2,Cute packaging.  Very cute earrings.
2,"Envoyé à temps, conforme à la description mais comme je le craignais, le clou a tendance à tourner sur lui-même et décale la figure géométrique."
2,Very nice earrings. Great packaging. Giving as a gift that I'm sure they will love.
2,"very cool, nice set of earrings, especially considering the affordable price"
2,Love the earrings. Just as expected and fast shipping
2,Very pretty but both V shapes can not be adjusted properly to point down so it moves around during the day.
2,cute earrings! fast shipping! thank you
2,"These are super cute, can't wait to give them to my daughter for Christmas."
2,I absolutely love my M&M magnets! VelvetCove u Rock!!! These are so pretty they look like the real candies! The magnetic hold is very strong that one will hold a Cardstock paper on your fridge. One satisfied customer here. Thank you.
2,I am a teacher and I bought these to use in my math groups with my little ones.   They are perfect!  Thank you!
2,I just love my M&M’s magnets and as you can see they look pretty good on my fridge underneath the M&M NASCAR magnet that I have. Vroom vroom lets go racing boys!!
2,Thank you so much for my wonderful M&M magnets. They look 👀 pretty good on my fridge.
2,"The print was blurrier than expected and the shape of the bag was not quite as listed (more of a trapezoid), but the size is very good and perfect for what I needed."
2,Came very quick! Shirt looked great! Would definitely order from them again
2,Delivered promptly. Item is just as expected.
2,As advertised! Quick shipping too.
2,"Love the pouch, the colors..it’s durable. Really great, thanks!"
2,Perfectly beautiful earrings!  I wore them on my wedding day and got so many compliments!
2,"Unique!  Only wish that that I can rotate the triangle in all directions to change up the look, but based on where my piercing is, it's difficult to get a full rotation or make it look even on both sides.  still love these though and I get compliments when I wear them"
2,Love these!  Incredibly light weight and very cute.  I ordered them in gold.  I haven't removed them since they arrived and get lots of compliments!
2,Love love love my new earrings!! More beautiful than I imagined they would be. Made and packaged with care. I will be back for more. Thank you so much! Love and light to you and your family. Stay well.
2,Their great lots of complements!
2,I am so please with this owner ! My ears were reacting to the metal and the owner gladly sent me a pair that worked much better ! Beautiful quality and an overall great experience. Thank you so much!
2,"Exactly what I expected! They are a bit sharp, though, and will scratch skin that comes near it. Otherwise, they are simple and everyday-wearable."
2,Love the earrings! Slightly larger than the pic but still adorable.  Receive lots of compliments
2,Simply beautiful.
2,"This seller provides excellent customer service. My earjackets were lost in mail & a replacement pair arrived in the blink of an eye. I love these.  Really.  See my 2nd review, I bought another pair!"
2,quality and very unique. i love these earrings!
2,"Quick ship. Love these ear jackets, so bought another pair in brass."
2,"Love everything I ordered... Some gifts for others, some treats for me!
Wonderful customer service and speedy shipping!!!
Will definitely be a return shopper!"
2,Great quality and super cute!
2,These are my new favorite earrings!
2,"Wearing these everyday, don't want to take them out.  Thanks so much!  I have really small earlobes and they still look great!"
2,Lovely finish. Just enough something special!
2,"Perfect! Just the right size, exactly what I was looking for!"
2,Love these!! So cute!
2,"Beautiful, great quality! They are very comfortable and just as described!"
2,I'm pleased with this purchase.  The jackets are cute and reasonably priced.
2,Cute!  The seller was so kind to keep in touch to make sure my order was to my liking.  Speedy and Professional:)
2,These are different and fun and the quality is nice.  Service and communication was good and transaction went smoothly.   These earrings were a gift and look great on the recipient.
2,These are cute but much thinner than I expected.
2,"A PARTE DE TARDAR CASI UN MES EN LLEGAR, MUY DECEPCIONADA CON LA COMPRA.
MAL REMATADO, SE VE DE MUY MALA CALIDAD, Y NI ME LO PUEDO PONER PORQUE EL PALO ES MAS CORTO DE LO NORMAL Y NO LLEGA PARA PONER LA TUERCA.
MI EXPERIENCIA UN 0."
2,"I really like these, but they're a little big and don't sit straight."
2,Muy bonitos. Quedan bien en cualquier oreja. Bien diseñados
2,Unique and gorgeous design.
2,They arrived today and are beautiful!  Thank you so much! I look forward to wearing them. :)
2,So cute and exactly as pictured! Goes with so many different looks and I've already had someone ask where I got them!
2,Item just as described & even more beautiful in person
2,"The small triangles are so thin and small that they barely show up. Maybe a raised surface might help. I think these would be great in gold or a (the adjective escapes me now) shiny silver. I don't think that, for me, the flat/brushed silver is good. Will give as a gift."
2,Très sympa comme style et qualité plutôt bonne.
2,"They feel a little heavy on my ears, but I’m sure I’ll get used to it the more I wear them. Other than that, I like them."
2,"Very pretty, very comfortable, and perfectly unique. True to picture."
2,The back triangle is a little bigger than I expected (but I also have very small earlobes). Definitely well made.
2,My roommate loved them! I got them as a gift and couldn’t stop gushing about them. Thank you!
2,Got these as a christmas present for a friend and she loved them! Very cute in person!
2,"Lovely, unique design.  Thank you!"
2,"The earrings are a bit sharp, and they're difficult to put on because the hole in the backing of the large triangle is tiny (so that they don't budge when the smaller stud goes through). I also think if the earrings were slightly thicker they'd probably be more comfortable. However, they do look really cool once they're in your ears."
2,These were a gift for my sister. She really likes them. They are very pretty and nice quality.
2,I really do love these ear jackets. They look exactly as pictured but just a little sharp around the edges. This probably wouldn't be a problem for most but my two year old finds a way to hit them perfectly to pin the points into my neck.
2,"Minimalist design, much larger than expected and therefore I am unable to wear them. The design is great however."
2,"The earrings are cute and delivery was very fast.   The back triangle is not attached to the earring back, so it can be a little tricky to get on."
2,Too big for my small ears. But really beautiful. Not made with very strong material.
2,it was much bigger than expected
2,I only wear the small triangle front. My earlobes are too big to see the back one.
2,The jewelry looked cheap and it shouldn't when paying $40. The brass looked bent and used . I bought them as a gift for Xmas and I'm embarrassed .
2,Funky and cool looking earrings. Although the actual material is darker than in the picture.
2,"Emmanuela is truly amazing!!  The quality of her work and her designs are so worth waiting for.  Wow!  She is also super responsive when you have a question and no custom order is too complicated.  Great shop, great work, great artist!  I highly, highly recommend her."
2,They are stunning in real life!
2,I've now ordered 3 earrings from emmanuelaGR and I love them all! They're unique and well made. I get a ton of compliments. And they arrived quickly. I'll be back for more!
2,"Wow.  I love the earrings! High quality product, style and packaging.  I will most definitely be ordering again soon.  These are absolutely beautiful."
2,I. Love. These. Earrings! Incredibly fast international shipping despite a global pandemic. I will absolutely be buying more from this seller!

2,"I absolutely love my Savi Jewelry order, thank you!

I have never had any issues with an order being fragile or loose etc, I am not sure why others are saying they are having issues because I have ordered over 50 peices of jewelry in the past 3 years and Savi is the only place I now buy my jewels from. 

I order for family and friends for Birthdays and Christmas and no one has ever had an issue or complaints either and absolutely loves their Savi Jewelry.

2,Beautiful craftmanship!  Shipment arrived safe.
2,"LOVE these earrings! This is the first pair of ear climbers I’ve ever owned, and they’re lovely. I ordered the pearly white color and they came just as pictured. I was concerned they would look odd with my second piercings, but the earring covers them up beautify. The left earring fit perfectly but the right one was a little too curved for my ear shape, so I had to bend it a little bit but now it looks just as good as the left one. They stay in place really well unless they get caught on something (like a hair brush). The gold accent bead makes them even more unique and I love the extra flair that it gives. I’m very pleased with my purchase. Would definitely recommend!"
2,"I sadly just discovered the sorcery that IS the “ear climber,” and now I am simply doomed. These are so cute, so simple and so classic, and I am going to be the talk of the town when I flaunt these tomorrow! Thank you!"
2,So cute! I love that it actually stays in and doesn't have to be adjusted every 2 seconds!
2,Love!!!
2,I LOVE my new earclimber! Fits my third piercing perfectly. I’ll probably be back for more.
2,Love these gorgeous accessories! Well-crafted and quickly shipped and received. Will def do  repeat business with this shop again in the future!
2,"Seller worked w/ me well... 

Beautiful handmade earring."
2,"Very gorgeous and sexy. I love them, yes you get two for this great price!!"
2,Gorgeous. I get so many compliments when I wear this.
2,Beautiful!
2,Love the way it looks.  Thanks!
2,"I love this. Originally ordered it to put on the 2nd piercing on both sides, but if I put it in my lower piercing, I can still put the teardrop earrings from the same shop in my upper piercing-- I love it and get a ton of compliments and questions on where I've obtained my earrings."
2,Beautiful and fits great! Always get compliments :)
2,This piece was beautiful! Thank you.
2,Beautiful! These are my favorite earrings!
2,The earrings are lovely!  I've already received so many compliments :)
2,These are very delicate I'm attractive earrings. I enjoyed the gold with the turquoise beads. Good quality and fast service.
2,Very cute and unique earrings!  Fast shipping - thanks!
2,I like them but too long for my ear!
2,"My first order arrived partially damaged from shipping. On one of the climbers, the beads had been busted and the metal was severely bent. I contacted the seller to see if I could get a single replacement and the seller quickly sent out a brand new pair, which are in perfect condition and fit my ears snugly. Very pleased with the service and product."
2,Very pretty. Got my earrings on time
2,"I love the concept of the ear climber- it's different from regular earrings and therefore appealing; once in place easy to wear. However, these and others I've tried don't stay in place after a while and must be re-set which is annoying. Do you have any hints to keep them ""climbing the ear""?"
2,Fit was just a bit to big.
2,"Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop."
2,"People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!"
2,"These are even more gorgeous in person! Lovely packaging, timely delivery, and quality pieces! Couldn't be happier!"
2,These are BEAUTIFUL!!!  I love them!!  They are exactly as pictured. Renegadesilver was amazing with any questions I had and shipping was fast. Would definitely buy from this shop over and over.
2,"Beautiful! Lovely craftsmanship. A really unique piece that I love wearing, it gets a few compliments! Excellent seller."
2,"Love them!!! They look awesome with both.  Wonderful earrings!  Thanks so much for all the help, patience & speedy ship!"
2,"Beautiful ear jackets that I always get compliments on them. Also, great customer service from this vendor. Very happy and will make more purchases from them!"
2,I get nothing but compliments with these amazing ear jackets!!!! Awesome :)
2,These are lovely! They are very unique and comfortable. I also like how versatile they are. You can wear just the bar studs for a more minimal look.
2,"Beautiful and well crafted earrings! 

Catie and Courtney were also wonderful to work with and personally made sure that earrings arrived on time to be gifted.

Great experience. Shop with confidence!"
2,Gorgeous!  Easily my favorite earrings.  They are striking but perfect for everyday.  Thank you so much!
2,"The earrings are even more beautiful than they are in the photo, and go very well with everything I wear. They're minimalistic, classy, and spunky all at the same time, which is quite a feat, if I might say so. The purchasing process went very smoothly and the earrings arrived all the way here in Hong Kong without a hitch. Thank you!"
2,"Love love love these earrings! I get so many compliments. So pretty, and really comfortable to wear."

2,"Love these earrings I get tons of compliments! Great customer service, will be purchasing again :)"
2,Gahhhh! So stunning. I just love them. Thank you!
2,"Earrings came about 1 week after placing order (5d to CA). They're very pretty and unique, I'll definitely order again from this shop. Came with 2 pairs of rubber backings- perfect because I promptly flung one of the backings into the nether regions of my bathroom upon trying them on. Fits perfect. The bars are large, if you want a daintier look maybe go with a different stud combo (ie the leaves with a smaller bar)."
2,I am in love with these earrings!!!!
2,As described. I love the simple look of the ear jackets but how unique they still are. I can't wait to rock these!
2,"These are unique and beautiful, and I get lots of compliments on them. Had an issue with the first package and Catie was quick in resolving it and sending a replacement. Very grateful (and love this shop in general!)"
2,Everything was fantastic! Love that the earrings were made to order.  Definitely will be ordering again.
2,Arrived quickly in a super cute package. Love the look and received a tone of compliments already.

2,I can't stop wearing these! I love them!
2,Beautifully constructed. Very unique. Arrived on time.
2,"The earrings are really pretty and one of a kind, but they're very expensive and a few things don't match the price: first, I would've liked to get proper silver backings instead of the cheap rubber ones, it feels like I have bought these earrings from some cheap teenage shop. And second, the packaging is quite bad, the earrings are hanging on a simple piece of cardboard, inside the tiniest cardboard box, coated with cheap foam. Apart from that, I love the earrings."
2,"Funky, beautiful, and comfortable to wear."
2,"Shipped on time, good quality, love it!"
2,Just like the pictures.
2,Great quality and are very pretty on.
2,Very cute! I love them. Thanks!

2,"I don't think I'll ever take these earrings off! Incredibly stunning earrings. Seller was a pleasure to work with, earrings arrived quickly and were exactly what I wanted."

2,"It looks very nice, fast delivery."
2,"Really gorgeous earrings, thank you so much!"
2,Very pretty and delicate. Thank you!
2,Love the earrings. Would use this seller again. Thanks.
2,These are beautiful earrings however for the price I paid I would expect a proper backing for the earring. the rubber ones that were sent I had problems with. They were slipping off and not staying in place.
2,"Very cool!  Well-made, and fast shipping - thanks!"
2,"Beautiful earrings, but wish I had requested metal backs.  The plastic backers were hard on the posts, which bent when put on."
2,Cute earrings! Thank you for fast shipping!
2,Exactly as described and great product! Thanks :)
2,Love the earrings! Service was poor. Given excuses when I asked where my item was. 7 days for a item to ship when it says 2-3 days!
2,Lovely earrings many thanks
2,Cute earrings. Was surprised that there was no sterling silver backing. Only plastic rubber.
2,They were exactly as described. I loved them.
2,Gaff not no. H no llll.
2,"They are Beautiful thank you . Packaging is super cute and Fast Shipping too, I will definitely order another pair . I Love them"

2,These are beautiful.  Love them a lot!!!
2,Fast shipping. Beautiful earrings. Good quality.
2,Fabulous!  Super fast shipping too!
2,"The earrings are beautiful, but I failed to read how long they are. They are a little big for my ears (I didn't realize I had such small ears?!), but they are everything they say they are. The quality is amazing and they stay in place well. 
Thank you! ✌🏼️❤️"
2,"I love these earrings, they're definitely my style, just a bit unique, but I can still wear them to work! I've gotten SO many compliments and they stay in place on my ears! People have even asked where I bought them! Love Love Them!!"
2,My new fave earrings! My hair is really short its not easy to have statement stud earrings that aren't bulky or childish. Love these!

2,arrived quickly and looks amazing- thank you!
2,Ordering and products are great.
2,this was a gift and well received

Gracy was so sweet, as well.  I live in Michigan, so it took 3 weeks to arrive.  Unfortunately, at Christmas, my package sat in US Customs for nearly 2 weeks!"

2,"I really liked these earrings and bought them for myself and my two best friends.  One of them has already worn them and told me she's gotten many compliments.  They are light and thin so super easy to wear, but long enough to make a statement.  The owner also gave me a heads up that shipping time might take long, but came quicker than I expected with little lace bags to give as gifts.  The owner even threw in an initial ring, which was very nice.  I would recommend these, especially for the price!"
2,Adore these earrings and the seller was very responsive.  great purchase overall and I am wearing them with EVERYTHING!
2,"Wonderful and responsive seller. These are easily one of my new favorite earrings (and included was a sweet midi ring, which I love!). Not only that, but shipping was super-fast and everything was carefully packaged into a sturdy little box and wrapped in felt. This is a shop that cares about the customer, and it shows. Definitely recommend!"
2,These are my new favorite pair! Shop was so kind and easy to work with. Obsessed with these earrings!!
2,"The item came beautifully wrapped and is as described. Shipping to Canada from Indonesia took over a month, but it was worth the wait! The X on the earring seems smaller than the photos - it is more suitable for people with smaller ears I think."
2,"Gorgeous earrings and absolutely amazing service! Delivery was much faster than expected and i received the earrings in a super cute little box, with personal handwritten messages AND a really pretty ring with my initial on it as a free (!) surprise gift. I love both the earrings and the ring, and wear them a lot, and can't praise Henju enough for the customer service. Will defo buy more stuff from her! :)"
2,"For international shipping, these earrings arrived very quickly! :) Love the minimalist design of these earrings!  Fun to wear and not sharp.  Looks just like the photo!  Thank you!!"
2,Love them!
2,Earrings are beautiful! Came with a special note and free ring! Love the whole experience! Highly recommended!
2,Thank you!! Earrings are exactly what I wanted. Very cute! Shipping said 2 to 4 weeks and I received my package in 3 weeks so I was happy about that. The earrings were also packaged with a fun freebie inside. :)
2,"These earrings are so darling, and they came with a very sweet thank you from the shop owner! They were worth the wait, after coming from so far away.  :)"
2,"Was worth the wait!  Very cute, well made, and came in a pretty box with a bow and a handwritten note.  Also got a free gift!  Thank you so much!"

2,I love my it!!!! Fast delivery and such a nice card and gift from Gracie
2,"Love!! Etsy insists I use more words in my review, but just ""Love!"" is all you need to know!"
2,"Very nice, simple earrings.  Seller was sweet to interact with.  She thought of everything - the items were boxed up in a nice gift wrap, with cushion to avoid damage.  When I opened it I was thinking, ""it would be nice if these were a bit shinier,""...then I looked, and she included a polishing cloth!

Shipping took time."
2,thank you - I love them!!!
2,Beautiful
2,"The X earrings are Beautiful. I have not worn yet, but looking forward to wearing them on date night. Thank You."

2,"Really awesome earrings, I love the design!"
2,"These are adorable, but they don't stay in for more than 5 seconds. They need a backing to hold them in place. I lost one before I even left my house -- still looking for it in the rug."
2,"Absolutely love this seller, the earrings were shipped with an awesome message...enjoy your journey!  I'm gonna do that & enjoy my beautiful earrings!"

2,They bend when you are wearing them. Then they just never look straight again.
2,Interesting and unique earrings - and thanks for the little extra gift
2,So pretty! I have thin wrists so I bought the 5.5 size and it fits me perfectly! It's not too tight or too loose. I love it so much :)
2,So cute and tiny! I bought the Rose Gold Finish and I love the color. My ears are pretty sensitive but these earrings don't seem to hurt very much. It does feel a bit irritated on one side but it's fine.
2,"She always goes above and beyond to give me such a special experience for my custom orders. I have to be honest and say that this one is EXACTLY what I requested due to the gemstones I researched... and I like the ones she designed with her gemstone choices better! 😝 PHENOMENAL muse! Looking forward to the luck, wealth, and prosperity for 2021!"
2,I waited a week and a half so that I could give an honest review of the moon earrings. My ears are extremely allergic and this is the first time in almost 5 years that I was able to use a pair of earrings for more than an hour! I haven’t taken them off since I got them on the mail. They’re super cute and minimalistic and i’m definitely getting another pair from apartment020!
2,"These are the cutest earrings.  My daughter and I took a bee keeping course together and she couldn't love these earrings more!  They came wrapped in Christmas paper because they were a Christmas gift.  Beyond necessary, but very appreciated!"
2,The owner nailed it on my custom bracelet! It is so beautiful and well made. Quality is superb. Great communication about the design I had in mind for my custom order and any suggestions made by the owner were discussed prior to shipment of my purchase. Fast shipping as well. I'm so happy with my bracelet! Do not hesitate to ask about custom orders. You will not be disappointed.
2,"These earrings are just as described; cute, dainty and well made. I wear the same earrings every day, so quality matters, and I haven’t stopped wearing these since I got them 2 months ago. Shipped super fast and came with a hand written note. 10 out of 10, would recommend 😊"
2,"Absolutely love these!! Perfect size, great quality, the post wasn't too long or too short. My normally sensitive ears did not feel a thing when I put these on. Highly recommend!"
2,"After having a stillbirth in April, I wanted something to help remind me that a positive pregnancy is possible. This is a BEAUTIFUL bracelet and it is so well made. It makes me smile just looking at it."
2,Fits amazing! I absolutely love love love this bracelet. It’s beautiful and came in beautiful packaging. I also have noticed positive changes in my life since I received it. 10/10 would absolutely recommend
2,These earrings are beautiful ♥️. Perfect delicate earrings for every day reminds me of Peter Pan which I also love “ second star to the right” that was one of the things that drew me to this set. I love the fact they are made in Toronto it’s nice to support someone local .. shopping small you are supporting someone’s dream
2,"These earrings are so subtle and lovely. Great quality, nice packaging, and great customer service from the seller."
2,"Absolutely stunning! These are so cute and the perfect size. They are super sparkly and could pass as real diamonds. Plus, the packaging was very cute. Def my new fav earrings"

2,Very tiny but super cute.  Great to just leave in all the time.  Wish I could get a little larger pair too!!

2,"I got these as a gift for someone, so can't speak to using them personally.  But the shipping was quite fast (considering), and they look great.  They are smaller than expected (less than 1cm) but I probably just didn't read the measurements.  Overall I'm quite happy."
2,"I love these earrings! Super cute, and very high quality. They are exactly as pictured, and shipped very quickly. Highly recommended 😊"
2,"Really love these squirrels, they're really adorable and so cute. Also dispatched right away and arrived in a cute little box. Would be really nice as a gift"
2,"The earrings are perfect!  They arrived quickly and because I had marked them as a gift, they were even wrapped in Christmas paper with a ribbon.  All I did was add a tag and my niece loved them!"
2,The bracelet exceeded my expectations. Will definitely buy from here again :)
2,"they are AMAZING! feel super high quality, and come with two earring backs. i ordered a couple things from the shop, with this being for myself and the others gifts, so i recommend that if you’re buying multiple earrings for different people to try asking for different paper for each pair (what i wish i did!)"
2,I love it!  It has a very calming effect and it's beautiful.  The quality is great and the service exceptional. I have ordered a number of bracelets from apartment020 and love everyone of them.
2,They’re so cute! Just like the picture :)
2,Ordered a custom bracket and was very happy with the final product. The seller was a pleasure to work with. I would definitely order from this shop again.
2,"Perfectly crafted sparkling star earrings for my teen niece. She loved them, and I love how beautifully it was wrapped and boxed! Thank you! 💜"
2,"I got these as a gift for someone, so can't speak to using them personally.  But the shipping was quite fast (considering), and they look great.  They are smaller than expected (less than 1cm) but I probably just didn't read the measurements.  Overall I'm quite happy."
2,I believe the service was truly exceptional....communication was a awesome and I do appreciate the effort made with my custom request....the design exceeded my expectations and I plan to do more business in the very near future...I highly recommend this customer...
2,"It is gorgeous and looks nice on my arm. I like jewelry I can wear with everything....casual, formal and informal. This bracelet works. The energy is amazing. I cleansed and energized it in my selenite bowl. Thank you."
2,"I am in love with this bracelet, i wear it everyday! The owner is really nice too. I will definitely buy again from this store :)"
2,"A solid, very clean cut. Perfect size for me, I love these crescent studs!"
2,"Love love love!! These moon earrings are now a staple in my wardrobe, they are beautiful. Definitely recommend to anyone looking to purchase them!"
2,"I love these little earrings! Christmas gift for myself. Great customer service too, so that's a giant plus!"
2,I mistakenly thought the bracelets had not arrived. The small package had fallen down between other larger packages and I finally found it. All my fault. I give the seller lots of credit because she went to the ends of the earth to help me locate package (feel so bad!) and she even offered me a refund. The bracelets are very good quality! The jade color is gorgeous! I thought the rose quartz would be more pink-more like it looked in the photos. I hope the seller can forgive me for my mistake! Thank you Apt020 for the pretty bracelets!!
2,love it! shipping took longer than expected but it's understandable due to the current circumstances
2,Beautiful!! I loved every detail of it.
2,"They're super cute, exactly as pictured. They just ended up getting in way too late with the only shipping option due to USPS this year."
2,Love these! They are perfect 🤩
2,Beautiful! Arrived quickly and look exactly as pictured. I love them!
2,I have ordered a number of bracelets from apartment020 and the quality is great!  This one is another beautiful bracelet.  My sister will love it. It's met for her. The service is amazing!

2,Absolutely stunning bracelet! I am so happy and excited it came so quickly💕
2,I got 2 of these. One for myself and one for my mom. Impeccable quality! Beautiful green color and fit is just perfect. I ordered a 3rd one for my sister yesterday. She must have it too.
2,SO GORGEOUS! These have become my every day wearers and I get compliments wherever I go!!
2,Very nice beautiful I love the beads. Thanks to the seller.
2,"GET IT. It looks really good, everybody thinks it is the mejuri one. Only reason it is not 5 stars is because the clasp is not gold plated i guess and has turned brown, I also saw little glimmers of the corroding color on the chains, but mostly it looks like it did when I first got it. (I do wear my necklaces in the shower and swimming though and this one has held up well for the month-ish I've had it.)"
2,Je les adore :) Elles sont confortables et super service :)
2,"Beautiful bracelets and the very kind, helpful seller! I was very happy that it came in super pretty gift wrapping too :)"

2,Very cute earrings and it was fast shipping. Love it

2,"They are super pretty but very, very fragile. The ear cuff on the climber broke off as I was taking my earring off. I owned them for less than a month when it happened. I'm disappointed."
2,Very nice but a little smaller than I would have like.
2,"Absolutely gorgeous! I'm in love with these earrings, thank you for the extra gift!"
2,"I literally love these. Kathy custom made mine as my ear is rather small, and it's perfect. xx"
2,"Love these earings! So unique and so we'll made. I would give them 10 starts if I could!

Kathy was so nice to work with and so considerate with communication and sending updates. Took about 5 weeks to receive but well worth the wait!!"
2,"I am absolutely in LOVE with these earrings. They are so stunning and the picture doesn’t even do it justice. And Kathy is even better! I ordered these earrings very close to Christmas and she was SO kind and accommodating. I received the earrings so quickly and they were packaged so nicely and with a sweet note! It’s also really nice that these fit really nicely around my second earring, since the piercing is still rather new and I like to keep the earrings in. So beautiful! They’re my new favorites!"
2,"Beautiful earrings, very comfortable.  Shipping was so incredibly fast, I got it far before I expected to.  The only thing I would caution other buyers about is that if you have smaller ears/earlobes the earrings might not stay upright very well.  I didn't think about it before ordering, but I do have smaller lobes and the fit isn't snug enough to stay exactly where I'd like.  That's my fault for not considering it though, and I do still love the earrings even though they end up a bit diagonal on me.  Thank you very very much!!!"
2,"Absolutely fabulous!
I was expecting them to have more of a hand-made look, but no, they are polished, and even, and just beautiful! Will wear them on my wedding! 10/10 would recommend."
2,"The earrings are absolutely beautiful! It took me a while to receive them, because I live on a different continent, but they worth the wait, and Kathy was exceptionally supportive."
2,I am absolutely in love with the Venus earrings! They’re so unique and look so cute on. Would highly recommend!
2,"Kathy is so talented! I adore these earrings and wear then daily. They are so unique and I get so many compliments!!

Completely worth the wait! Kathy was quick to respond with updates as she handmade each piece. Took about 4 weeks to receive."
2,My new faves!!! Love them so much! Thank you so much
2,"As always - I’m in love <3 I absolutely love these earrings! So different, so original... ahh :))"
2,"I literally love this earring. Kathy custom made mine as my ear is rather small, and it's perfect. xx"
2,💖 love it
2,"Vraiment super beau et une belle finition, je les porte tous les jours, elle ne sont pas trop lourde et vraiment confortable ! 

Un gros merci à l'artiste ! 😁♥️"
2,The earrings are fantastic! Definitely what i expected! Love this store!
2,I love this item! High quality and simple yet unique. It’s become my go-to earring. Seller was also very lovey and communicative throughout. Thank you!
2,"Beautiful, unique design and high quality construction."
2,"This is honestly the most unique piece of jewelry I own!! You will not regret buying from Kathy. Messages are answered quickly, orders arrive on time, and purchases are packaged beautifully!!! Don’t hesitate to buy from this seller❤️❤️❤️"
2,"This has to be my most favourite purchase on Etsy and one of my most favourite pendants. I’ve been on the hunt for a good scarab necklace because of my fascination and love for Ancient Egypt but nothing has ever caught my eye as much as this pendant. I’ve been wearing it since I received it yesterday and I am head over heels in love. The pendant has quite a solid weight, the details very subtle but still evident and all in all a very, very beautiful and excellent piece of work. The slim chain that I got with it is very sturdy and matches very well with the pendant. Kathy is a lovely seller, she answered all my questions and even included a little gift with my purchase. Will buy from her again!!!!"
2,"Absolutely gorgeous! I'm in love with these earrings, thank you for the extra gift!"
2,"I ADORE these earrings! Worn them pretty much every day since I got them. The gold on the post wore off a teeny bit, but the part of the earring you can actually see / care about still looks great 2+ months later. Would re-buy."
2,Love it so much! I get complimements every time i wear it
2,"Beautifully made! I've never seen anything like it, it's a real eyecatcher and I get tons of compliments whenever I wear it."
2,"Absolutely gorgeous! I'm in love with these earrings, thank you for the extra gift!"
2,"My order was custom maid, the large moon pendant with blue stones in silver because my friend is allergic to anything else. Kathy was always quick with answering any question and providing assistance. The order was ready after 2 weeks as she promised and arrived quick and safely wrapped. Her work is beautiful and perfect. One can see that it is made with love. It won‘t be my last order! :)"
2,"These are my everyday go-to earrings now and I LOVE them! (Also, yes, they took some time to get here but it was well within the timeline given by the seller and I knew what I was getting into when I made my purchase. Definitely worth the wait!!)"
2,I LOVE this ring!!! 😍😍 It’s better than I expected and I’m super stoked that I bought it because I’m wearing it all the time now.
2,I love all moon jewelry this earrings is next in my collection 😍
2,"J’adore <3 bons contacts avec la vendeuse, et bijoux magnifiques !"
2,"Oh my god it’s amazing! Really beautiful, and it is a little heavy but that’s kind of reassuring of its quality and to make sure it’s there. The only thing I’ll say is AirPods can be used with them but they hang out slightly when the earring is in"
2,"Lovely and light!

I only wear jumbo earrings and am used to them being heavy. 

It was nice to find that these are feather light and so elegantly constructed. The closer is different from shown in the listing photos and I think is a design improvement. 

Love!"
2,"The necklace, though smaller than I thought, is absolutely stunning. It has a very minimalist style and definitely was ~the~ chain necklace I’ve been looking for- not too chunky, not too bulky, just the right amount of both. While it has a good weight, it is not uncomfortable to wear and because of its simplistic style, layering it with other necklaces is not a problem. In addition, Kathy is an amazing seller!!! She is a very easy person to communicate with and very sweet as well! Will come back for more!"
2,"In theory I love the way these look. In practice they don’t work. The heavy hoop pulls the suspenders off your ear’s fold, so they stick out at angles and look dorky. Sigh. They’re lovely. They just don’t work the way they’re meant to.

Later reducing to one star, as the welding just snapped. Will return."
2,Such a cool and unique piece of jewelry. I live it! Looks great. Seems to be a good quality. Very happy with this purchase.
2,"Extremely beautiful, stylish and best quality. Kathy is so nice and helpful, my favourite shop ❤"
2,"Antes de pedirlos, tenía dudas, pregunté a Kathy y me las resolvió rápido. Estoy contentísima con los pendientes😍, muy bien empaquetados, con unos detalles muy cuidados, llegaron en perfectas condiciones.

Kathy es una artesana excepcional y un encanto de persona, muy amable y atenta☺️. La calidad  y el diseño de sus productos es ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. Recomiendo comprarle 100% .

¡¡¡Miles de gracias Kathy por todo el cariño, las horas de trabajo y el esfuerzo que has puesto a la hora de realizar los pendientes. Un abrazo muy muy muy grande desde España, tu clienta Olga 💫!!!"

2,"I love it!. My earring is beautiful
!, also Kathy's service is exceptional."
2,"I simply love this ring. It looks so precious, it´s minimalistic design comes out sooo wonderfully, you don´t need to wear any more jewelry besides, because the ring alone is very strong.
It´s cofortable and I can´t take off my eyes from it, simply love :-)
After a bit struggling start, the communication was very nice and Kathy worked fast and prefessional, thanks alot :-)"
2,Wife loves the earrings! Would def shop again with same designer.
2,Gorgeous earrings! They are very good quality. Thank you for the extra present too. :)
2,"Just gorgeous. Each piece of jewelry I've ordered is simply stunning, and I could not be more pleased with the quality. The lapis pendant is delicate and rich in color, and with more gold than expected. Can't wait to gift such a beautiful pendant."
2,Love the simple and modern look.
2,"I wear this choker every single day. I do not think I've taken it off since I received it. The quality is excellent and I love the way it looks on me. I highly recommend this shop as this is not the first item I have purchased. Keep in mind that it does take awhile to arrive, but the craftsmanship is unmatched. Absolutely worth the wait."
2,"The seller herself was so amazing, if you have any questions she responds so quickly which is great! And the ring is so beautifully created! An all around great purchase!"
2,"I'm really happy with the moon ring, bought the matching necklace also. These are just what I've been looking everywhere for. The craftsmanship is excellent and the seller is really nice. Very pleased with my purchase(s). :)"
2,"Love it so much!
Thank you! :)"
2,"Love, love, love! I got this shell ring in silver for my 16 year old daughter. She loved it! So did my 19 year old daughter, and so did I. So I got the same ring in gold plated for us. We all are so happy with this ring!!!!"
2,I love it 🥰 thank u so much
2,Beautiful and well-done handcrafted earrings. Reliable Seller.

Got a little surprise inside as well :)
Very happy and excited about my purchase."
2,"My bracelet arrived today and its magnificent, ordered 20cm and it fits my wrist wonderfully! It is adjustable as well so easy to put on. :)"
2,Stunning! The green insert is just the most exquisite colour and pops!
2,"These earring are super duper rad and well made......buuuuut they turn my ears a color so I’m not quite sure the whole earring is sterling silver. In any case, this probably won’t deter me from by one of the other cool designs."
2,"A gorgeous ring. Very comfortable with a simple, elegant design. Wow!! Thank you."
2,"Gorgeous, and very unique and eye-catching."
2,Really solid and looks so good in person.
2,Beautiful scarab ring and great addition to my collection! Great communication from Kathy. And thank you for the extra gift! I bought this with the matching pendant too. I have more items on my favorites list. Thank you!
2,"Sparkles and shines! Not too thick or thin. Makes a statement alone but versatile enough to pair with other jewelry. Has a nice weight to it. Very solid quality and workmanship. Seller is very caring, highly recommend. I will be back."
2,"Absolutely beautiful necklace. I haven't taken it off since it arrived. Highly recommend getting yourself one of these treasures. I'm slowly buying an entire set, just ordered the matching bracelet. :)"
2,This is one of the nicest handmade pieces I have seen. I love it and will be buying more creations in the future for sure. Customer service is excellent and it shipped and was delivered as promised. Please support Kathy Ross as she is very talented. Τα κοσμήματα είναι πολύ καλοφτιαγμένα και πολύ όμορφα
2,Amazing piece!  And Kathy was very responsive was able to make a small change to the earring to fit my needs. Overall a wonderful seller and experience!  Thank you!
2,"BE CAREFUL!  The horns are razor sharp!  First time wearing it, and last, the ring not only dug into my finger and poked it to blood, but when I was resting my face on my hand, while at a restaurant, and then moved it to gesture, one of the horns caught my lip and tore it to blood. In addition, this ring tore a perfect line-cut in my favorite shirt when I reached behind myself, even though the ring faced out and away from my back.  It looks like I used an exacto-knife to cut my shirt.  I cannot imagine someone  handling a baby or pets while wearing this ring.  I politely reached out to seller almost a month ago to return this ring but she never responded!  The audacity! And Etsy had the nerve to deny my case b/c it 'looks as described'.  I filed a case with BBB and my credit card company.  Worst shopping experience of my life!"
2,"Lovely earrings, could have done with another hole option for the rear post though!"
2,Kathy’s work is outstanding. Well made. The stone is magnificent and well set. My fiance hasn’t taken it off for over a year now. She says girls (both coworkers and strangers) grab her hand and praise it’s beauty nearly every day.
2,"Thank you again, dear! Just received the package last night and already wearing them today! <3"
2,"Honestly, this could be the best handmade 925 silver chain i got."
2,"Great quality, love it! Bought 2 in different lengths!"
2,Amazing will definitely buy again! Lovely seller!!
2,Gorgeous and one-of-a-kind piece!  I love the creativity that shines through in the design
2,"As always, Kathy never fails to impress. A mesmerizing and elegant ring that immediately catches the eye. I love it, as I love all of Kathy's works. Third purchase from her, I'll keep buying. Thank you Kathy! ❤️"
2,It arrived fast and it is absolutely gorgeous!! Loved it! Thanks so much!
2,excellent! I get so many compliments on these earrings!
2,This is my 3rd ring I've purchased from this shop!!! I love all her designs and I wish I could buy them all. I do know I will be purchasing 2 more rings for my birthday! I have a problem....

2,Not only is the piece beautiful but it came quicker then I expected. Love it!
2,Such a great necklace. I am in love! ❤️
2,This is a beautiful minimalist necklace. The bar gives it a modern touch quoting current trends in piercing jewelry. Very elegant as the dangling portion of the chain leads your eye down to the cleavage... great for plunging necklines.
2,Exactement comme décrit dans l'annonce. Très joli.
2,Really solid silver pendant and the necklace is adjustable! Perfect work!
2,I wear it every day
2,The order ended up being cancelled but Kathy provided great customer service. Looking forward to ordering from her shop in the future.

2,This ring is beautiful and amazing!!! Many thanks!

2,Love these - don't even know I have them in
2,"These are great, and constructed very well.  They were comfortable to wear, and I have actually worn them in a few different ways (not just lower ear climbers).  Minimalist, but still impactful and versatile."

2,"Lovely and unique , I'm so happy with it!"
2,"The item is lovely. I really, really like it. Shipping took a very *long* time. I ordered it July the 24th. They shipped the 27th, it didn't arrive until Sept. 09. Be prepared for a wait."

2,Always a pleasure.
2,"A very sweet ear climber that, for me, worked best in the first piercing. When trying to place it further up the ear it wouldn't stay in place very long. I had planned to have just one of them farther up my ear for an asymmetrical look, but I'm buying the second to wear as a pair for a nice clean look instead."
2,"Great Earrings, fantastic communications...would shop here again!"
2,"They are beautiful and delicate, exactly as pictured. Thank you!"

And guess what??!! I've just bought another pair lol..I just can't keep away😉
Thank you so much 💖 xxxx"
2,"love these earrings. They are climbers, but they aren't obnoxiously climbers, so if you're looking for something that is similiar, but not all the way up your earlobe, these are the ones. The titanium is great for my daughter who has a nickel allergy. We have the silver matte finish, and I am thinking about orderring a pair for myself, or maybe stealing my daughter's pair. ships from Greece, so it does take a minute getting here, but they are beautifully wrapped. Went in easter basket."
2,"These are so cute, I'm completely in love with them! Fast shipping too- will purchase from again!"

Absolutely lovely and very well done."

2,Very sweet.  Reach for the stars
2,"Just right, engineered to stay in place, great work."
2,"Great earrings,   my 14 years old daughter loves them! Thank you"
2,Arrived very promptly.  Beautifully made.  Love them.
2,"Shipped very quickly. The earrings do feel secure when I wear them, but I would feel better if they came with a small back just to make sure they stay in my ears."
2,"Piece of garbage , no quality , i didn't even wear it once👎🏻"
2,"Shipped quicker than I thought! Only got the right silver one, but now I might have to get the left one too"
2,"Amazing!!! Im so in love with my new earrrings! They are trendy and unique, without being too ""out there"". I can wear them out for drinks, to my job as a nurse and to school. Perfect to wear anywhere. Very easy to put in and comfortable to wear. Ive gotten so many compliments! I love them that much- I plan on buying another set for ""backup""."

Thank u! I love it"

2,I love this! it fits great in my ear and shipped so fast!
2,"I LOVE these earrings! I wear them almost every day and have gotten so many compliments on them. Great quality, shipped fast and with care!

2,"Love, love, love this. I've tried buying ear climbers at other stores and they weren't made correctly and wouldn't stay up at the top, but this one hugs my ear perfectly!"
2,Shipped quickly! A little bummed because it's just a litttttleee to long to really fit in on my ear. I can still wear it though (just a little awkward. Other than that I love this piece!
2,"These earrings are beautiful and very well made. Sadly, they didn't work for me, but the return process was very easy and fast. I will defiantly buy from this shop again"
2,"Lovely earrings. I bought two without even thinking I might get two for the same ear, as these are advertised singularly, but man is she good and sent me one for each ear!!!!  Just love them! Stunning statement without being gaudy 😍"
2,I loved this product. It was the perfect size and comes exactly as shown. The best part about it was the fact that can be bent slightly to adapt to different ear shapes. I straightened mine out the tiniest bit and it fits perfectly. I could not have asked for a better piece.
2,"Super nice! Really pleased with my purchase, the rose gold is the perfect colour."
2,"This ear climber is gorgeous, and I get tons of compliments on it. I like that the posts are silver, and they don't irritate my very sensitive ears. Would buy from this shop again."

2,"Super cute, shipped fast! 4 stars because the metal is slightly irritating to my sensitive ears."

2,"UPDATE:
I did end up returning the original but was offered a custom order. She made the front piece thinner and it's perfect!
------------
I love this item, I'm just afraid because it's so delicate, the backing will eventually break off from putting it on and taking off"
2,Very beautiful but very delicate!
2,"Very pretty! Simple, but makes a big impact! These made a lovely gift for my best friend!"
2,Love this. Simple stylish and edgy. Have gotten many compliments.

2,"simple, arrived quickly and exactly as pictured"
2,"Love the style , but lost it already.
Dosent stay on the ear well at all , wore it out for 3 hours and got home to notice it missing/lost.
Nothing like throwing away $$.
I will look for design similar that attaches better."
2,Beautiful and super fast shipping
2,Very happy with purchase and delivery!
2,Looks fantastic but the back support piece is very soft and easily bent. Just need to be careful with it.
2,"They are very pretty, but for what I paid they are very flimsy. They are super bendable and do not stay pressed to my ears and fall off. I'm pretty sad with the purchase... $50 gone for earrings I can never wear :("
2,She really liked them......... Timely delivery
2,Arrived quickly and very high quality
2,"Great item, my mom loves it!"

2,The earrings are fabulous! Greatly appreciate their simplicity & minimalistic nature.  Thank you!!! <33
2,"These are my new favorite pair of earrings! They seriously go with everything. They were packaged securely and arrived in as timely a manner as I could have hoped, given that they came from another continent. I don't buy much jewelry, but I can definitely see myself buying more pieces from airlab!"
2,My new favorite earrings! Love them.
2,Really love these earrings. They are a lot smaller and more delicate looking than I expected but they are stunning. Thank you
2,"Delicate and beautifully hand made, these were shipped quickly and securely! Maybe it is just my curved earlobes, but the triangle ear jackets weigh next to nothing so they may not hang straight downwards. Your ears may differ. Thank-you for the earrings."

2,I love my new pair of earrings! I get so many compliments about them!
2,"I really love these. As far as earring jackets go they are pretty unique in design/pattern and I really like that. Honestly,  I find them a little pricey compared to what I am used to paying in the U.S. even from handmade artisans, but not a ton, and their uniqueness was enough to make me want to buy them anyway. Quality was great. If the prices went down a little I'd probably buy a lot more but can't say I would at this time priced as they were when I bought them."
2,These earrings are exquisite!  I'm going to wear them every day for the rest of my life.  feminine & sweet
2,Beautifully packaged and very well made. Really cute and look great on.

2,Love it!! Exactly what I was looking for. Will definitely order from this shop again. Thank you!!!
2,"This is the first time I’ve purchased from Poppychain and USPS had unfortunately lost my package. However, after informing Kat, she was so responsive and helpful in trying to call my local USPS and locating it (which is a whole frustrating task in itself), and then finally having to send another order out which I appreciated a lot. I love the small minimal earrings I bought. They were exactly as described in the descriptions and photos. I am looking forward to wearing more items from the shop! thanks Kat!"
2,Very cool. Transforms my vintage studs into modern jewelry.
2,"Thank you - these little chains are extremely versatile, giving lots of different looks with simple studs and small hoops. Very pleased"

2,very cute and dainty ! i wanted a chain i could use with a variety of earrings and this was perfect
2,super cute and afforable!
2,"So cute, I love it 💕 thanks!! (And fast delivery!)"
2,"Very beautiful and delicate. Came in right on time. Actually I believe it came in early. Sadly I didn't pay attention to the description and got one I was allergic to. I sent in an email and got an immediate response  concerning my situation. She was very nice and more than happy to help. She aloud me to exchange my item for something I was not allergic to and was completely understanding. I was shocked because most shops and stores won't let you return specific jewelry even if it hadn't been used. Just make sure you read the description of what you're purchasing before you complete the transaction. That was my mistake. Overall, I would recommend to anyone!! 
Very happy that we have good people out there with all the chaos going on!!😄"
2,"Beautiful chain, worked exactly how I wanted it to!"
2,Perfect for connecting two studs on the same ear. Just what I wanted!
2,This is high quality and looks exactly like the picture when I wore it for the first time I was so happy. The chain looks like it goes with my earrings and I’m so glad I bought it.
2,Simple and beautiful! Just what I was looking for. These look great on various studs that I have.
2,"Beautiful, tiny, dainty chain!"
2,"2"" chain is perfect for the look I want.  thanks :-)"
2,These are perfect and so versatile.
2,The chain is so delicate and perfect!  The shipping was quick! I have found the same chain elsewhere for twice the price! Thank you!
2,I love this ear chain so much.
2,It is beautiful and dainty. Absolutely in love! Thank you!

Was het niet waard"
2,"perfect size, and nice quality"
2,"perfect size, and nice quality"
2,"perfect size, and nice quality"
2,exactly what I was looking for at a great price:)
2,Just as described!
2,Super fast shipping! Thanks!
2,"Is ok for the price but not worth putting on earrings on the earlobes. They’re so small and dainty you can’t even see them. If you want to see one dangle, get it longer than an inch. Even after I write this, I’m still trying to use them on a conch piercing, but will not fit. So shop wisely cause you can’t return these."
2,"The chain is a little flimsy, but it gives the look I want for an affordable price :)"
2,This earing is so beautiful! I am so glad I bought it. It's beautiful and very well made. I love that it's not a stud so it doesn't hurt at all. I love love love this earing!
2,"So it took a while to get this little guy but I absolutely LOVE it! I got it for my cartilage piercing and it fits perfectly! Stylish and flows perfectly with my upper ear. Super sturdy too, so I think it’ll hold up well for daily wear!"
2,These are so fun! I switch them between my second and third holes- the texture catches the light just so!
2,I fell in love with these earrings as soon as I put them on!! They’re absolutely gorgeous!
2,Absolutely beautiful! I would give these a 5 star rating if they didn't slip out of the ear so easily. I think they need to come with small rubber backs to keep them secure. I have already lost one and I am so disappointed..
2,Voor mijn vriendin gekocht. Ze is er super blij mee! Heel mooi en subtiel
2,Awesome!
2,"Merci beaucoup, elles sont magnifiques !
Tout a fait conforme"
2,"Editing my review. Gorgeous piece in solid gold that appears to contour with your ear well. However, it just wouldn’t stay up, and kept falling out of my piercing. Any attempts to pinch it shut more or to add a rubber earring back to at least keep it in my ear just made it more uncomfortable to wear. I love the look, but I sadly won’t be wearing it much."
2,"The customer service was fast and lovely. The package came with a handwritten note and a cute lollipop 🥰, thanks! The earcuffs are very nice - they are easy to put on, they don't pinch the ear and they fit snugly, and most of all - are as pretty as they were on the pictures provided by KivotosJewelry. 10/10 would buy again 😁"
2,I really like it. You can adjust the hook so it can fit your ear shape
2,"Just arrived 3 minutes ago.  Wow!  Just beautiful!  Many thanks.
Constance"
2,"Really beautiful earrings, worth the wait!! Love them! Thank you!"
2,The dark purple and green leaves are gorgeous and I’m sure my friend will love this as much as I did when I opened the parcel.
2,The shop responds quickly to messages and the cuff was very pretty! Great all around!
2,Stunning and comfortable! I adore it✨💕
2,"Unique, beautiful and timely. Kivotos is a wonderful artist!"
2,"Je viens de la recevoir, j'aime beaucoup beaucoup
Envoi soigné 👌"
2,The earrings look even better in person! Very detailed and beautiful.
2,Very beautiful and fit perfectly
2,The earrings are so elegant can't wait to wear them!
2,Same as above.  Thanks again.
2,Gorgeous earrings. Thank you very much!
2,Even prettier in person and arrived super fast. Liked them so much that I bought another pair of earrings in a different color
2,"Fast shipping considering it came from overseas! Literally my new favorite ring, I get compliments on it everywhere I go!"
2,"I thought the jewelry looked great on the page, but it manages to be even more stunning in person. It is beautifully made!"
2,"As always, beautiful product, fast international shipping. I get most of my earrings from Shlomit Ofir, and I get so many compliments! Love this designer."
2,I wanted the leaf climber for my right ear.  Make sure you specify which ear.
2,WELL worth the wait through customs honestly! quality is great and they're so cute! i know i'll get a lot of wear out of them
2,Same thing as the tiny hoops. They are so cute! Just a bit faded/worn on the part that goes into the earlobe.
2,These are my new daily earrings! I LOVE them. Thank you!
2,"Absolutely beautiful, instantly became one of my favourites 😍"
2,"I love all the jewelry! It came in such a cute box, really good quality and it looks even prettier than in the pictures :-) Love it! Thank you!"
2,"Ordered these for myself for my boys to give me for Christmas.  I definitely peeked when they arrived, and they look exactly like the picture.  Can't wait to enjoy them!"
2,"Beautiful earings, a tiny bit too long for my tiny lobs but nevermind, I love them !"
2,"I love all the jewelry! It came in such a cute box, really good quality and it looks even prettier than in the pictures :-) Love it! Thank you!"
2,The earrings are nice but if you have thick lobes like mine it won't look as good as in the pictures.
2,"These hoops are the perfect size and look cute, for whatever reason the part that goes into the ear is worn and I can see the metal underneath the gold coating."
2,Superbe
2,"Adorables fines et légères !
merci beaucoup 😊"
2,"repeat buyer, always happy with items, quality is very good, packaging is well down, pieces are always great, these are always some of my favorite pieces in my collection"

2,These earrings are SO beautiful. Thank you so much - also for the great customer Service:)
2,"This necklace is the perfect length for me. It layers well with other necklaces, but also works well alone. I'm quite pleased with the purchase and really liked the way it was packaged. Much love!"
2,"Absolutely lovely, the size was perfectly customized for me. This anklet is very beautiful and delicate !"
2,"Beautiful earrings! Also quick to ship. Add these to your collection, you won't regret it!"

2,"Les boucles d'oreilles sont magnifiques et originales ! 

La poste local avait perdu mon colis mais Shlomit Ofir m'a beaucoup aidé en me renvoyant un nouvel article. 

Je l'en remercie encore !"
2,"so beautiful and well made-sturdy, fit well, and not ""cheap"""
2,"repeat buyer, always happy with items, quality is very good, packaging is well down, pieces are always great, these are always some of my favorite pieces in my collection"
2,"repeat buyer, always happy with items, quality is very good, packaging is well down, pieces are always great, these are always some of my favorite pieces in my collection"
2,"My fiance loves this bracelet. The moment we saw it, you could immediately tell this bracelet is well-made and obviously beautiful."
2,"The earrings are beeaautiful! Thank you so much for your talent of creating such extraordinary pieces. Can’t emphasize enough how much I love the design.

The earring backs are rubber, which are kind of a disservice to the elegant piece. But I’ll take the compromise for the 24K plating than lower quality plating. Cost, cost, cost.

I impart the warning to others to be mentally prepared of VERY delayed shipping during this health crisis. The shipping from Israel to NYC was A MONTH — and there were many days where there were no shipping updates whatsoever (not seller’s fault; 75% delay due to Israel Post and 25% delay due to USPS). That said, her reliable communication helped my eager self to be patient."
2,"repeat buyer, always happy with items, quality is very good, packaging is well down, pieces are always great, these are always some of my favorite pieces in my collection"
2,These are so cute... even the packaging was cute! Great craftsmanship
2,"When I first received this ring, I was in love. It was just what I was looking for. Sadly, after about 2 weeks of wearing it, the white enamel became discolored and just peeled off. Now I just have a plan gold ring that looks pretty tacky. I'm pretty bummed considering how expensive it was. My advice would be to not buy this ring if you plan on wearing it everyday. It will not withstand everyday use."
2,"Really like the bracelet--but I wish it was just a little longer--is a little snug on me--nice gold color
I will add on 2 links to make it fit better"
2,Ces boucles d'oreille sont parfaites !
2,These are a show stopper. I have not worn it once without people asking about it and giving me compliments
2,I get a lot of compliments on these!  Very good quality.
2,Beautiful little set. Sized more for a child than for an adult but the quality is amazing. Shipping was over a month from Israel to US.
2,Better than I anticipated! Came in the cutest box and in a glass bottle. This necklace is so Dainty and perfect!
2,I love these! They are so beautiful and versatile as I can wear the studs without the jacket as well. Thanks so much!
2,Les boucles d'oreilles sont vraiment jolies ! Colis reçu environ 1 mois après avoir commandé.
2,Love this ring! Can’t wait to buy more from this store. Everything fits my aesthetic perfectly :-)
2,"I bought this bracelet as a birthday gift for my sister and she absolutely loves it!  It’s very pretty and delicate, it looks gorgeous on her!"
2,"Magnifique, comme toujours. Envoi rapide, soigné et bijou d'une grande finesse."
2,"beautiful and well made, thank you!"
2,"Just beautiful! More than I could have hoped for.  Be aware if shopping from UK there is a customs duty to pay, but they are worth it!"
2,very pretty. More petite  than I had anticipated but lovely just the same.
2,"Très belle boucles d'oreilles, très discrètes, légères et très bien emballées. 
Je recommande :)"
2,The earrings are lovely but uncomfortable. The wire that goes through the ear seems to be thicker than the wires/posts in my other pairs of earrings.  I could see myself wearing these every day if only they were comfortable. Disappointed.
2,Boucles d'oreilles reçues très belles et de grande qualité
2,"My favourite artisan-love, love the product. Ships quickly, well made & unique!"
2,"In the words of my mother,  ""these are very special."""
2,"Good quality ring, fast shipping. I like all the items I buy from Shlomit"
2,They are beautiful! Perfect quality!
2,What a gorgeous ring! Beautiful design & perfect fit. Have worn it every day since it arrived. Would absolutely purchase from this seller again. 5 stars!!
2,Beautiful and light as a feather. I love them !
2,"beautiful, excellent quality, unique design... love it! thank you!"
2,So nice!
2,"Expected delays in shipping d/t the world’s pandemic. Ring is exquisite. 
Thank you!"
2,So cute! I love them and they are so well made!
2,"Beautiful bracelet that shapes to the perfect size. It came in a cute box with a little brochure describing a little bit about the women-owned, Israeli company which I loved. I will definitely be shopping here again!"
2,Item is lovely! Just what I wanted. It did take a while to arrive but it was coming from another country during Christmas and the pandemic.
2,Parfait ! Je recommandz vivement
2,So impressed yet again. Everything I've ordered from Shlomit Ofir has been beautiful and wonderfully made. Thank you!
2,"Beautiful, as I expected, love them! Thank you!"
2,"Beautiful, as I expected, love them! Thank you!"

2,Absolutely gorgeous! This was a birthday gift for a friend and she was immediately in love with it. Would definitely recommend.
2,"Auch nach vier Wochen Wartezeit ist die Brosche leider immer noch nicht bei mir angekommen

Ich muss meine Bewertung nochmal ändern... das Paket wurde durch den Deutschen Zoll solange aufgehalten...

Chen war sehr bemüht und ist meiner Nachfrage gleich nachgegangen.

Die Brosche ist wunderschön"
2,moins joli qu'en photo mais fera quand même son petit effet

2,My mom absolutely loves the necklace! Thank you so much :)
2,Beautiful. Many thanks really like these earings
2,"It's a beautiful ring. Unique shape. A little sharp on the edges, so I have to be mindful not to wear it around my toddler or do any drastic face sweeps, else I scratch skin."
2,"Awesome ring. Wearing it with such pride! 
Thank you!!!! Gorgeous!"
2,"Magnifique, comme toujours. Envoi rapide, soigné et bijou d'une grande finesse."
2,"It's so beautiful, but it broke within 5 minutes of opening. We glued it back together, but it's very fragile."
2,Just as gorgeous in person. Already looking for more pieces from this shop.
2,"Really love them, but i had to pay 15 euros of customs..."
2,"Beautiful necklace, contemporary and solid in construction"
2,"Arrived safely, but tangled to Canada. Perfect length and timeless design."
2,"Superb-looking earrings, great product! Thanks!"
2,Très belle broche. Superbe! Merci
2,"Magnifique bijoux d’une très belle finition, dommage que j’ai du payer 50€ de douane la moitié du prix pour mes deux achat."
2,"Magnifique bague, le style art deco est vraiment original. 
La bague n est pas parfaitement régulière, ce qui lui donne du charme. Je recommande cette boutique."
2,It was a present for my sister and she absolutely loved them. Thank you!
2,Looks beautiful.  This is a gift.  Item arrived very quickly and was very pleased.  It looks to be of great quality.  Would love to get one for me!
2,"REALLY DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING FROM THIS SHOP.
I have been waiting for this item over two month now and no one from the shop has come back to me. I am extremely disappointed by the service and by how unprofessional SHLOMIT OFIR has been. I am still waiting for my refund and no one came back to me. If you want to lose some money, buy from this shop!"
2,The ring is exactly as pictured!
2,The ring is lovely - thank you!
2,"A perfect gift, very cute and well presented."
2,"Beware of ordering from this company! They say “fast shipping” which is absolutely untrue. I get that COVID has made things challenging, but the tracking on my end shows that the package has not left Israel as of today, and I ordered the gift on Dec 5th. Now, they are not agreeing to provide me with a full refund.

Buyer Beware! It’s a scam."
2,"Classy ring, just love it--in silver   great style and value"
2,Arrived quickly and as pictured
2,"La bague est très belle , un peu plus petite que ce à quoi je m'attendais ( mais ce n'est pas un problème)"
2,"The necklace is just perfect, thanks!"
2,"Des bijoux d’une très belle qualité, dommage pour les 50€ de frais de douane."
2,"Le collier est conforme à la description, il est très jolie"
2,"Bijou très délicat, et quelle bonne idée de pouvoir choisir autant d'oisillons que d'enfants !"
2,"Fidèle à la photo, je ne suis jamais déçue"
2,Never received this item and no communication from business owner. Unacceptable service
2,This was a gift. Super fast shipping! Beautiful bracelet! Thanks again!!
2,Very pretty anklet! Thank you!
2,Earrings were very pretty but unfortunately gave me an allergic reaction
2,Arrived in good time and my mum loved it!
2,"Lovely and quick shipping, thank you!"
2,"Can only give one star as I never received my order. When I contacted the seller, she was completely dismissive and offered no ways to help.
Ordered was expected on 12/15-16. It is now 12/29."
2,"I come to Etsy to support artists, not con artists. Not worth the money (tacky) and poor customer service. I looked at the measurements before ordering and this still feels smaller than I expected. The disrespect and disregard from the seller made me feel like my business or happiness was not important at all. 

The color for the mountains is not flush with the wood...it’s cheap laminate glued on. Not what I expected for something that is normally $62. 

Comes in a bag that says “use two nails or screws to install”....Umm this was over $50 so You definitely need to include all of the hardware required. 

All in all, strongly DONT recommend."
2,"Great birthday gift, unique and arrived swiftly!"
2,"Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs – I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it."
2,Elles sont très belles. Un peu difficile de les mettre au début mais je m'habitue. Le trou de mon oreille est un peu trop bas donc l'effet n'est pas aussi beau que sur la photo mais ce n'est pas la faute de celle qui les a fabriquer. Je vais surement recommander...Merci!!
2,"Took a while to get here but totally worth the wait. Beautifully made, delicate, and unique. I was worried about the sizing of the lower part on my earlobe but there are three holes so you can get the perfect fit."
2,"Beautiful, well crafted & unique earrings! Great customer service; I will definitely shop here again."
2,"Beau produit. J'ai de
Beaux commentaires sur mes boucles
D'oreille minimalistes. Je les
Aime beaucoup et le service est top!"
2,"Exactly what I wanted! Light weight and comfortable. Beautifully packaged and fast shipping. This is my second time ordering from LeCubicule, and I'm always happy with my orders."
2,Love them! These are my new favorite earrings! :)
2,"Ich mag sie, weil sie so schön dezent sind. Lieben Dank!"
2,Love these earrings! I get compliments on them all the time :)
2,"Magnifique, délicat, j'adore! Merci pour cette belle création."
2,"Elles sont parfaites, l'emballage est craquant, un petit plus à ma commande!
Seul Poste Canada a fait que le délai était long mais rien à voir avec la boutique qui a bien respecté la date d'envoi."
2,Super posibles y bonitos. Gracias
2,#1 ! J'adore vraiment beaucoup !
2,"Love these earrings, I've gotten nothing but compliments. No problem sleeping in them either."
2,"Elles sont parfaites, merci!"
2,I ordered the smaller size pearls. They were lovely and delicate.
2,"Elles sont simplement magnifiques! Excellent service, merci beaucoup!"
2,Parfaites à offrir en cadeau. Merci :)
2,"Vraiment, ce sont de très jolies boucles d'oreille. Merci beaucoup."
2,Son unos pendientes muy bonitos y muy comodos
2,Très sympa et de bonne qualité.
2,Receive several compliments on this ear jacket. Very nice!
2,"I am EXTREMELY happy with my beautiful earrings. 

When I ordered these, the package had to go through ""customs"" and unfortunately were not repacked properly and subsequently were lost. I  contacted the shop/vendor and they immediately sent out another pair and secured the new pair to make sure proper receipt of my order. Great customer service and lovely craftsmanship of jewelry."
2,Granddaughter loved these!
2,A sophisticated take on an ear jacket.
2,I don’t believe the shipping was the seller’s fault although it took a month for the item to arrive.  The seller was very responsive to my inquiry.
2,"If there was a way to make the earring one piece, I would rate 5 stars. I like the look a lot but they are difficult to get on with 2 pieces and then the back. Already lost one piece down the baseboard and took 30 min to fish it out. Other than that, cute!!"
2,Did not fit my ear very well
2,"I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something  that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!"
2,"These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again."
2,"So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it."
2,They are beautiful! My ears are not sensitive to metal either! Yaye!
2,I love my earpins!  Packed well and shipped quickly.
2,I have really sensitive ears. And multiple piercing holes in my ears that I dont use and hope to cover up. These are perfect! My ears are not unhappy either which is a big win for me!!!
2,"Favoriting the shop and on the look out for new designs. 

Not as rose gold as I thought it would be but i loooove the look of it :) 

It's pretty comfortable and so far it feels nonexistent on my ears. I have incredibly sensitive ears as well, so that's saying a lot."
2,A really fun and cool piece of jewelry. Sits nicely on my ear and looks very pretty!
2,These earrings worked out great for my bridesmaids! The fact that they are surgical steel made it so I didn't ave to worry about allergies and they fit all of their ears without slipping or falling.
2,"These earrings came quickly and were well packed. I like that they can be worn over the piercing (more like a cuff) or through it (although I've had a little trouble getting them in that way but that's user error!). They will be perfect for our Fall, outdoor engagement pics! Thanks again!"
2,"Just as beautiful as the pictures, easy to put on, stayed in place most of the day. A little long for my ear, but they still look great."
2,These earrings are great! They are exactly like the picture and came very quickly. I would definitely buy from this shop again.
2,"I'm very satisfied with these. They're my first pair of ear climbers, and they do exactly what they're supposed to do. They are a good size, too, but don't dwarf your ear or anything. For the price the quality is quite good."
2,Great quality product. Love them!
2,"Lovely! My first pair of climber earrings, and they are comfortable and stay in place. Very pleased."
2,Very beautiful and easy to wear with everything
2,"El Brillo, la textura, el diseño"
2,Earrings are adorable!
2,Really nice quality!
2,Good quality product and fast shipping for coming from Canada to USA. Got the earrings as a present for my sister and she loves them.
2,"Bought these for my 14 year old and she has been wearing them since I gave them to her, 5 days straight! And she almost never wears earrings. They look great :)"
2,Really beautiful pieces=-) They have a tendency to let go of my ear and hang down though.
2,I really like these earrings but they always swing down and don’t stay in place. Not sure if it’s my ears or the product.
2,"I LOVE these earrings!!  My ear piercing closed, but I'm still able to wear these by securing it under my ear lobe. I (reluctantly) gave my mom the other pair that I bought because she loved it too!"
2,I feel like a forest fairy every time I wear them. They came promptly and the metal is ok even for my sensitive ears.
2,"Beautiful earrings, exactly as pictured and arrived quickly!!"
2,Very cute- exactly as pictured.
2,Wear them daily! Great for sensitive ears!
2,Beautiful earrings. Arrived quickly. No hassle!
2,Beautiful item and great quality. However it would be great if it was easier to figure out wether an item was sent as a single earring or a pair. I ordered two because the description said ‘ear vine’ without a plural. I thought I’d get one pair of two not two pairs.
2,"like it, wish it was a post, not a wire."
2,"They’re incredible quality and absolutely gorgeous. I’ve only had them for a month, and they are by far my most worn earrings. I love them! They don’t start to leave any kind of green marks on my ears like a lot of other silver jewelry- they just look amazing :) They don’t tangle at all, which I expected them to so that was a great surprise. Overall, they’re incredible earrings and I’m so glad I ordered them!"
2,Love the earrings. So dainty and unusual.Prompt transaction and would recommend.
2,"Beautiful jewellery, and the packaging was so gorgeous I almost didn't want to open it! Thanks, I love the earrings :)"
2,Super fast delivery and gorgeous product.  I love them!
2,Unique and I love them 😍
2,Very good quality and beautifully crafted. The packaging was incredibly beautiful and felt like a lot of love and thought had been put into it—a very pleasant surprise!
2,"This was my second purchase of these earnings as when my daughter saw them she wanted some! They arrived promptly and were beautifully wrapped in recycled material. They are much sturdier than I expected and i have not taken them out since i got my first pair about a month ago which means I have showered, slept and gone swimming with them in (probably not a good idea but I'm lazy about changing my earrings). I love them!"
2,"Perfect earrings, and WOW how beautiful your lettering was on the envelope!"
2,"Gorgeous, well-made, delicate, elegant looking - these earrings are just what I hoped for! Thank you so much! Loved the packaging, too :)"
2,Wunderschön. Die Größe ist perfekt.
2,"Lovely item, alternative but understated. Well wrapped with recycled paper and a lovely hand written note. I am very pleased."
2,Lovely earrings!!! Very unique. :)
2,Very nice! Just as descripted.
2,The back holders do not stay attached. But it's a really pretty piece.
2,"Bought a few of these now for both me and my daughters, they are lovely.Well worth the money."
2,Shipped fast and looks exactly like the photo. Thank you?
2,I'm getting so many complements for these ^_^ They're even prettier up close!
2,Love the earrings :) get lots of compliments when wearing them.

2,Just as described and shipped quickly. Beautiful earrings!
2,I never received my order but I was sent this message to review it.
2,The earrings are gorgeous! It was shipped very quickly and there was great customer service regarding my questions on how to best wear climber earrings. Would recommend.
2,"Absolutely love these. Thank you, they are stunning"
2,"The moonstone is more a bright white stone. It’s super pretty but doesn’t have the flashes of blue I’m used to with moonstone. That said, it’s super pretty"
2,"I chose the blanco color and they are beautiful! Good quality, size as indicated in the pics;  easy to put on and keep on."
2,Gorgeous product. Even better than expect. I bought them as a Christmas present for my best friend and I know she will love them. Extra points for the cute leather pouch and personalized note. This is why I continue to shop on esty.  💕
2,Really beautiful - bought these on a whim and they are absolutely lovely in person. Really recommend them. Great design
2,Shipped very quickly and is very cute and comfortable in my ear! Love!
2,Super pretty earclimbers and a perfect size too. Thanks!
2,"It looks great, and the earrings are made of quality materials. Will purchase from this store again!"
2,Love them! They look exactly like on the images and they arrived in a very nice box.
2,"Lovely Climbers. A quality setting. Unfortunately, a little large for my small ear lobes. They will be loved by someone else."
2,"Muy elegantes y finos, quedan genial!"
2,Très jolie! Elles ont beaucoup de succès auprès de mes amies.
2,"Son tal cual en las fotos, preciosos. Muy contenta, compraré más :)"

2,Very beautiful earrings and great customer service!
2,Very beautiful earrings and great customer service!
2,Absolutely love. I can’t wait to wear for my wedding
2,Fast shipping! Very pretty! Thank you!
2,"je cherchais depuis longtemps des ear cuff que je puisse poser sur la partie supérieur de l'oreille. lorsque j'ai vu les création de gpdesign j'ai tout de suite été intéressé et j'ai demandé une personnalisation. Et le résultat était génial! rien à redire, j'en ai déjà commandé 3! un grand merci!"
2,"I love it so much, I might get another one for the other ear.  Great quality, very impressive in a quiet way!"
2,"Vraiment ravie de ce choix ! Les deux anneaux sont absolument magnifiques, avec de belles couleurs profondes, et sont très agréables à porter. Ils donnent une ""signature"" toute nouvelle à mes cheveux courts. Les échanges avec la créatrice ont été très plaisants et l'envoi immédiat. Je referai une commande (voire plusieurs) avec certitude et plaisir."

2,"This is my second purchase from this shop, and it won't be the last.  The enamel is nicely done, with beautiful colors.  I recommend the red for a beginning try."
2,"Très beau bijoux, reçu rapidement, très bon contact avec Sandrine la Créatrice. Je pense que je lui achèterai d'autres bijoux..."
2,Love this earring it's extremely dainty for a bigger piece completely in love with it! Will definitely be using again in the future
2,I love this earring! My piecing is higher than the one in the listing but I think it still looks great!  I got the shortest option (4 mm) and it fits perfect!  Fast shipping too.
2,"I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!"
2,"This earring is gorgeous and I plan to wear to my wedding.  You can also flip it if you don't want it sticking outside of your ear, even though its very cute that way.  Very happy with my purchase and the customer service was great.  I got the 6mm for my helix and it fits ok (tad bit too long for me), but next time I might try the 4 mm.  You can purchase the labret itself for only a couple bucks to try for size."
2,So pretty! It is more dainty in person than what I was imagining from the picture but I was pleasantly surprised!  I am planning on wearing it at my wedding and it will match well with my  other jewelry. Thank you!
2,Arrived quickly and packaged with love. Beautiful quality!  Stunning piece. So happy. I love it. Thank u so much!
2,Love this! It's so different! Great customer service! Would work with seller again. However this earring is very difficult to put on and I lost the earring  a weeks after purchase. Hard to screw the back in and it comes loose.
2,So pretty.  Perfect size for my second hole.  I loved these.
2,Very cute and exactly what I was looking for. I always use 1/4 bar but I wished I ordered the next size up
2,"Gorgeous! Fancy, looks great in the helix!"
2,"Très beau bijou qui sort de l’ordinaire, plus brillant que ce que j’imaginais mais c’est parfait comme ça ! Packaging mignon et envoi soigné. Ravie de mon achat 😊"
2,Really beautiful! I took a photo but it did not show how lovely this item is. Arrived very quickly and in a box with a personalised message which is a great touch!
2,VERY beautiful and well made. Handled my custom requests beautifully. Great customer service!
2,Love it
2,"I bought this with the intention of wearing it on my top ear (cartilage) piercing, and it works perfect for this piercing/location. Overall; great piece, great quality
I'll be buying another one for the other ear soon! Love this adorable shop!"
2,Super cute!! Only issue is my hair gets caught on it but that's it. Thank you I love it. :)
2,The shipping was lightening fast and the item came exactly as described. As someone who has a very strong allergy to anything other than surgical steel or gold and it's been over a week and no issues at all and I haven't taken it out once. Loving this unique design and have gotten several compliments so far! Thank you!
2,Such great quality and lots of depth to this piece. I love it!
2,Amazin jewelry .i ❤️it

2,Love it so pretty! Fits great and came so quickly
2,Elegant and classy. Fast shipping and great customer service!
2,"I love the design. The only thing I had a problem with was deciding the length of the post. I now know I need a 6mm length. The 11mm I ordered spins. However, even the spin doesn't detract from the beauty of the design. I'll order another, definitely!"
2,Absolutely beautiful! Great for a night out!
2,Looks amazing in person! It looks just like the picture
2,Very pretty item that arrived on time - will be getting more in the future!

2,"Earrings are lovely, exactly what I was hoping for. I love that the posts are stainless steel as I have very sensitive ears and they have not turned my ears green or irritated them at all even after wearing them all day and night. Shipped faster then expected, owners responded to all my questions. Overall good experience with this shop. Will purchase from them again!"
2,"Absolutely beautiful piece of jewelry (and cute packaging)! Plus, it arrived in no time at all."

2,Gorgeous and arrived quickly!
2,Beautiful earrings. I bought two cartilage earrings and a pair of lobe regular earrings for a wedding I will attend.  These are the two cartilage.
2,Super sparkly and definitely noticeable. Just wish I had ordered a shorter rod because it keeps twisting and catching onto my hair unless I tie it up.
2,Fast shipping and beautiful earring!
2,Very prompt on delivery. Thankyou love my item.
2,exactly as described and looks sparkly and classy. love it!

2,Exquisite earring and it arrived promptly.
2,Arrived early. Piece fits well.
2,"So this earring is adorable. It is so cute and I have gotten tons of compliments on it. My only problem with the earring is that it will not stay in my ear. It has fallen out 4 times in the past few days. Luckily I have been able to find it when it falls out, but it makes me not want to wear it all the time because I know it is going to fall out and I am going to lose it"
2,"Not a fan, doesnt sit well in the ear, wasn't as cute as I expected it to be. Just overall, disappointing. I won't be purchasing again."
2,"Item came on time, exactly as shown on the pictures."
2,"The post was way to big of a gauge (I ordered smallest), and it hurts my cartilage. I can’t wear it."
2,Love them!

Sincerely Yours,

Catharina Hassid"

2,I love these Charlottes Web items. They are so pretty.
2,Love these earrings. They are very comfy and had lots of lovely compliments. Fast delivery. Thank you
2,"Good quality earrings, very elegant and arrived in good time. My only criticism is the presentation - they came just in a card sleeve.. So now I have to find a nice box to present them in. Apart from that, very happy. Thanks"
2,Lovely delicate ear climbing earrings will be a perfect present for Xmas this year. Arrived from UK on 19 October after being purchased on 28 September - very happy with the delivery time given the impact on shipping due to Covid.
2,"The bar at the back required some adjustment, but after that a stunning earring. I get complemented every time I wear these."

2,"nice design, fast and good service"
2,Lovely quality. Package included a gift box.
2,Very cute earrings! They are a little hard to get on at first but they seem to stay put once they're in.
2,"Truly beautiful earrings, exactly as in the picture. Unfortunately not for me, as they don’t stay put and I almost lost them a few times, they fell from my earlobes . Tried various ways, however they don’t work. Perhaps for someone else...😐"
2,"Liked it but lost it as it didn't have any backs, and fell off. Very sad."
2,They are so unique and beautifully crafted! Well worth the wait from the long trip overseas~! :)
2,"Absolutely gorgeous. The pictures don't do them justice, they're awesome! The presentation was also adorable and flawless; if you're considering them as a gift, get them!!"
2,"Me encanta! Siempre voy a recomendar CandyFoxx! Sus accesorios son hermosos en diseño y textura, no duden en comprar!"
2,"These earrings are beautiful and very original. The only thing is I thought, looking at the pictures, that the big part was smaller, it turned out to be bigger than I thought."
2,"Totally happy with these earrings : beautiful, simple but original, nice work and getting me a looot a compliments. Perfect."
2,"GREAT EARRINGS, QUALITY 100%, VERY COMFORTABLE, SO MANY COMPLIMENTS!!! THEY ALWAYS SHIP ON TIME!!!😄👍👍😄

2,"These earrings are beautiful! I love wearing them, my husband says that they are ""a true expression of my personality""! It is SO nice to support candyfoxx and know that my earrings are good quality and are made by someone who truly cares! I can tell that she cares because: 1. When my payment went through funny in the beginning, she helped me to resolve the issue and 2. The item arrived in perfect condition and you can tell that a lot of thought and care went into the packaging. SO pleased! Will be purchasing my next pair from candyfoxx as well!!!"
2,These earrings look great! just like their picture. Would definitely by more in other colors
2,Absolutely love these earrings - fab!
2,"Absolutely love these earrings! I'm actually going to order more, in other colors! Thank you so much!"
2,Very unique! A conversation piece :). I got black and white so I can mix and match :)
2,Great shop! Love my earrings and they came quickly and in perfect condition.  Recommended and will purchase again.
2,most wonderful earrings ! ! ! they look perfect !
2,"I love the the material,style and quality.  The problem is the backs ares a lot larger than they look on the model in the picture.  They just don't look right on me.  I wanted to love these!!!"
2,Just fabulous!! The earrings are of great quality. Super cute packaging! I will definitely be ordering another pair!
2,"Let me say this first: I absolutely love this style of earring. However, the quality of the white blocks was very low, and they looked very messy, and I really don't feel the price was justified. But, I do love the earrings quite a bit, its just if I had known now what I do, I wouldn't have paid more than $10 for them."
2,they are the best like always!
2,Perfect! They are exactly what I wanted and expected! Great quality and look amazing.
2,Absolutely LOVE these earrings. Shipping to Australia did take a while though.
2,Awesome!  Beautifully crafted.  I love them and will be purchasing more!
2,Really fun earrings. Will get a good deal of use this summer. Nicely made and packed.
2,"love these earring, so great!"
2,Love how they look! They're not super heavy but my ears aren't really used to anything more than studs so they hurt a bit. But I do like them 😊
2,Great earrings-want them in black too!
2,"Shipped fast, amazing design and very confortable item"
2,"Really cute earrings. A wee bit bigger than I thought they'd be but, still awesome!!!"
2,Bigger than expected. Great quality. Good packaging.

2,Lovely earrings. A bit bigger than I tought but very nice indeed:)
2,"As cute as pictured, good customer care"
2,Beautifully made and packaged item!
2,Great design and packaging good for an immediate present.
2,"I asked a question, no answer. Then I placed my order. Later on, I got another question, asked, answered!!! I am guessing you have to be actually paying to deserve attention. The earrings are cute, though the cubes aren’t perfect cube-shaped. I like how they are in general."
2,Great item and fast shipment. Thanks!
2,I loved the way they looked. However I wore them 1 day and took them off at night and the front square came off the post. Tried contacting the shop 3 times and never got a response.
2,"Very nice earrings, arrived kinda dirty though."
2,I wish they were a bit smaller. There very heavy/large which make them look awkward. I like the concept but too big .
2,"What can i say, they are beautiful !! Beautifully made, and look gorgeous on, and comfortable to wear also look very expensive, at the price they are, they are amazing !! People comment on how lovely and where i got them from. So well done, i love them and thank you."
2,"Earrings thoughtfully packaged, they are just as depicted/described & they seem to be of sturdy material. I have a few items Favorited from this shop & I will possibly shop again!"
2,Received my order earlier than expected. Beautiful earrings!
2,Your wardrobe needs this pair of earrings.they can be worn with everything you own ...exquisite
2,I love these ear jacket earrings!!
2,Everything went smoothly with the purchase. The earrings really sparkle on my daughter. She loves them! Grazie!
2,good quality piece; would buy again -- Thank you!
2,Nice piece. Def quality in the work and well built.
2,They were very good quality but were much larger than I expected.
2,The bar that holds the back stud hung down below my ear lobe. It looked funny. Tried twice to contact seller  but no response from them. I will not buy from this seller again.
2,I love these ear climbers so much! Very pretty!!
2,I have never written a review before on anything I purchase.. Maybe I'm too lazy. Anyway. These earrings are outstanding. The quality. The color of gold. The fact that they are a little malleable so you can gently bend them to fit your ear perfectly. The shipping did take a while.. I just got them yesterday and ordered a month ago (I'm in the US) . But it was worth the wait. Thank you!
2,❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
2,"These lovely, delicate, minimalistic ear climbers arrived after a couple of weeks, packaged very well. The seller also responded very quickly to my message. Pleased with my purchase :)"
2,These are super comfy and just the right length. I wear them all the time and always receive compliments. great price too!

2,"I bought these for my roommate and she LOVES them. She wears them all the time and gets so many compliments. They took a long time (a month) to arrive in the U.S., but they are beautiful!"

2,Very cute and unique!
2,"Beautiful, exactly as described and depicted"
2,"Earring broke within 24 hours. Reached out to the store and did not hear back. Luckily I was able to glue it back together. Love the earrings, just wish I hadn't needed to fix them so soon and that I had gotten some sort of response."
2,"I love these, especially the jacket part! The adjustable height is great for me (I have small earlobes and many jackets just don't fit me), and the simple design pairs well with all kinds of other stud earrings, not just the ones that come as part of this set. I'm currently wearing them with some lime green studs and have gotten multiple compliments on the interesting combo! The jacket is comfortable, but do know you have to push the butterfly back down the post to hold it in place, which takes some time to get used to if like me you normally keep the back at the end of the post."
2,"LOVE LOVE LOVE!  These earrings are perfect, really cute and subtle, easy to wear every day, and also great for dressing up.  Beautifully packaged, and arrived on time."
2,Great quality. Those are my favorite earrings. Simple and elegant. Will definitely be ordering more from this shop.
2,I just got these earrings and I love them! They look exactly as pictured and are super comfortable. High quality and light weight. Would purchase from this shop again.
2,"I adore these earrings! They are sturdy and fit perfectly, even with my previously-stretched lobes. Definitely my new daily go-to pair of earrings!"
2,"Have had these in my cart for weeks and so glad I finally hit the button. Cool, really well made and different earrings! Love them!"
2,"I was very happy to receive these earrings in the mail today! They're  unique, simple and subtle but have a very modern and clean look. I really like how you can adjust the bottom piece to fit you ear. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase and can't wait to wear them! Thanks!!"
2,Beautiful earrings that can be worn every day! The craftsmanship is perfect and they arrived quickly. I gets lots of compliments on this small but bold earrings!
2,The delivery came a week early! And I absolutely love both pairs I got. Super chic and unique!
2,"My earrings arrived today - I am a very happy customer.  The earrings are exactly as pictured, and arrived lightning fast!

2,"Got these for my trendy sister-in-law's birthday. Haven't seen her yet to deliver them, but I think she'll love them!"

2,"Fast, efficient service from the Seller. I bought these as a birthday gift for my teenage niece and she loves them!"
2,I have still not received this. The tracking shows still in transit but there has been no update since 12/9. I need to know the status on this ASAP. Is there a way to get in touch with USPS on this for an inquiry?
2,This is my second pair of aspera earrings and I’m obsessed. I love minimalist jewelry and theirs is unique and beautiful. Thank you.
2,These mini pin earrings were exactly what I was looking for to complete my daily earring look!  I'm wearing them in my double piercings and they are perfect.
2,"Quick to respond, rapid shipping and beautiful packaging! Earrings are the most dainty, beautiful, flattering and quality earrings! Bought theses for my wedding day earrings and couldn't be happier. Wear them whenever I have the chance now:)
 Thank you so much!"

2,These were a lot smaller than I was expecting it they are really cute. Great quality.
2,"Super cute earrings, but more importantly I was shocked by how comfortable they are, nothing pokes into your head like the backs of normal earrings. The only issue I have is that they can definitely fall out easily so be careful if you are for some reason moving around on a bed 🤷🏼‍♀️"
2,Simple and beautiful earrings. Love them.
2,"Beautiful little earrings! I'm wearing them for my wedding so I wish it had a little box or what not to keep it in until then, but I really appreciated the eco-friendly packaging and super fast service!! Will be buying another pair :)"
2,Adorable earrings! The shipped quickly and seem to be really good quality.
2,Beautiful. Shipping was a little slow. But the earrings were well worth the wait :)
2,They are perfect. thank you!
2,"They're pretty, but they're very flimsy. I don't think they're worth the price I paid for them, to be honest."
2,Great item at an amazing price! Came packaged professionally. The seller was more than happy to answer all my questions before I purchased the item.
2,"I don't know if I'm wearing it wrong, but it doesn't stay on very well so I haven't worn it, I'm afraid I'll lose it. Eh."
2,"Merci beaucoup, envoi soigné et rapide"
2,Sweet and oh-so-nicely package. Thanks so much!
2,"love these earrings, can't wait to wear them!"
2,So fine and delicate.  Shipped on time with care.
2,"gorgeous! arrived very quickly, thank you!"
2,"These ear climbers are perfect. They do have a little weight to them. If they slip, follow the instructions given on how to secure them on your ear lobes. They are so beautiful, I wear them all the time! Shipping was fast and secure. Will order from this shop again."
2,Loved it!!
2,LOVE the shape & colors!  Very nice!

2,Love these!  Not gaudy and adds interest to studs. Light and move beautifully
2,"Amazing packaging, very creative and eco friendly.  These jackets are great for wearing with any studs, haven't tried them slipped onto climbers yet but I can see them being amazing for that as well.  Very tempted to get the longer pair as well."
2,"So Beautiful
 And arrived so fast!
Thank you so much!🤗"
2,Bought these for my daughter and she's thrilled with them. I have to admit they do look good and will add variety to her ordinary studs. Thanks Tanglemoss.

Ook leuk gedaan een los cadeautasje.
De oorbellen zijn erg mooi en conform de foto"
2,Love the earrings! They just took a long time to get here.
2,Wundervoll- hochwertig verarbeitet und schick!
2,Love these!  They are very dainty and a perfect for my second holes. Different and subtle. I slept in them even. Very comfortable. I'll be back for more styles!  Thanks!
2,"Super cute, and actually looks really cute as a climber. 
One note - they are much much tinier than I anticipated. Refer to the picture on an actual ear, not the bowl picture :D"
2,Absolutely perfect!  I adore it.  I will 100% be back for more fun Ear pins!  Perfect transaction!
2,"I love my super chic ear pin climbers. They are well-made, and were packed so sweetly. I'm a regular LITTIONARY customer and will continue to be after this purchase!"
2,"These earrings are very cute. I was surprised at how tiny they are, they are smaller than I expected. They're very light, and I don't even notice the earrings while wearing them. Thank you very much!"
2,Love these! The cuffs are so simple and perfect for something different.
2,Adorable earrings in adorable packaging! They arrived quickly and are lovely; my only quibble is that the tiny ear climbers are a little too tiny for my plump earlobes. I flared them out and put them in my second holes and I think they're going to work!
2,They are small and absolutely perfect.  Exactly what I was looking for when I don't want to clash wearing silver and gold jewelry (I hate doing that). They shipped extremely fast!
2,They are small and absolutely perfect.  Exactly what I was looking for when I don't want to clash wearing silver and gold jewelry (I hate doing that). They shipped extremely fast!
2,"I love this ear pin!  It's tiny, it's different, it's sterling silver and it's so comfortable on you don't know it's there until someone says, ""Hey, wait a minute, let me see your ear...oh, WOW!"" and then they want to know where to get one, and I tell them. (I just rec'd this yesterday - beautifully packaged and so quickly from the east coast to my home on the west coast - and I've already had that reaction 3 times today.) I will be a repeat customer and highly recommend Littionary to anyone."
2,I put them on immediately and love them so very much. Thank you!! :)
2,Wonderfully dainty. the rose is the perfect tint!
2,Love these.
2,I've loved all the products ordered from Littionary and these were no different. They're perfect. Dainty yet sturdy and very cute. I'd buy them again in a heartbeat!
2,"Love it! My ears are super sensitive, and it only took about 3-4 days for my ear to adjust. It's minimal and totally work appropriate for a conservative work environment. Bonus: I'm super lazy and have no problems sleeping in it!"
2,Super fast shipping and SUPER CUTE EARRINGS! I love them to bits. Well made also.

2,I get compliments and questions about these all the time. They're so simple but they make a statement. :-)
2,LOVE THEM! They're like little staples on my earlobes lol
2,Beautiful and simple! They are perfect and shipping was quick!
2,Cute! They look a little like itty bitty staples.
2,I love these earrings so much. I lost them once so I bought them right back! Literally wear them everyday.
2,"Smaller than anticipated, yet once on I realized these are the perfect size!! Beautiful in person. Packaged very, very nicely. Thank you."
2,"I lost one of my pair, so I bought another one. Love that I can buy singles."
2,So small and dainty I love it!!
2,"Well made and timely shipping!!! 
I guess my only complaint is that I was expecting these to be a little bit wider on the front side, they have the appearance of staples in my ears. It doesn't really bother me and I wear them but like I said they are not the size I was expecting."
2,"Just what I was looking for. Simple, everyday earring. Love it."
2,Love this bar crawler earrings ... I've all ready order more earrings from  the LITTIONARY shop... Can't wait to wear them too...

2,"Perfect fit/size/look!

I love this unique piece, very lovely. I will purchase from this shop again."

2,"So simple, so beautiful, I love them! Thank you!"
2,"perfect, lovely, great quality per usual"
2,"Shipped fast, great packaging but they tarnished within 2 weeks! Totally not worth $36. I never wore them in the shower or anything, so I don't know what's up. 

Bummer."
2,loved them! thank you so much
2,"fast shipping, perfect every day earrings"
2,On time and super cute. Easy to wear and stays put!
2,Awesome earrings! Love the minimalist look and they go with everything! Thank you!
2,"They are a little smaller than I anticipated, but I still love them!"
2,They are the perfect minimalist earrings. They look great!
2,Exactly what I wanted. Love them!
2,"Initially I wasn't sure how these looked, but they have really grown on me. I wear them daily, and I love that they are minimal so I forget I'm wearing them."
2,Shipped promptly and item was as described. Cute lil pin!
2,Lovely as always!
2,This is great and I love it.

Great Seller!!!"
2,Perfect everyday earrings! Exactly as described.
2,Love this! I think I am going to order a second one.

2,"Delicate and simple, came pretty quickly. Thank you for your handwork, it's lovely!"
2,Perfect for daily wear!
2,I love these earrings! I just have to be careful not to wear them in the shower so I don't keep losing them down the drain. Great choice for people who have difficulty with studs and want something other than dangly earrings.
2,Perfect. Exactly what I was looking for!!
2,"2nd Purchase from Littionary, love this simple pair as much as my others!"
2,product as described but matte finish seems to wear quickly - currently wearing backwards as the finish is the normal and holding up much better
2,"Fantastic earring. Was confused about the ""single"" or ""pair"".Didn't realize that you only get one single earring. I feel silly now that only one came in the package. Quality is fantastic however, took ages to ship."
2,Beautiful earrings. Super fast delivery!!!! Highly recommended!!!
2,"Very cute and danty as described, my only issue would be that the earring is either very easily scratched or changes color a bit.  I barely wore it and the front of it has a streak that is discolored.  I am not sure if it was just unlucky.  All in all it's not too noticeable and i still think its quite cute!"
2,Very unique - I didn't even know these were exactly what I was looking for.
2,"Article de très bonne qualité, envoyé a tant et très bien embalé!"
2,"This are so simple and classic.  A great every day wear earring that looks unique and is really comfortable, forget I'm even wearing them."
2,"From the packaging to the earrings, SUBLIME and just what I wanted!"
2,Prompt delivery and adorable earrings!
2,Arrived very quickly and it's lovely and dainty!
2,Shipped and arrived quickly. Earrings are beautiful and perfect for someone who hates getting poked by stud earrings.
2,Fast shipping and great packaging. I'll definitely be doing business with this shop again. Thank you!
2,"Super cute, planning on wearing these everyday. Thank you!"
2,"Very pretty, simple earrings for everyday!"
2,"I was worried that they wouldnt stay up in the ""climbing"" position on my ear but they actually stay in place really well and do not irritate my sensitive ears. And they look awesome, very subtle and delicate."
2,I received my order promptly and it was just as described. Many thanks!
2,"Great earrings, excellent seller A+"

2,Perfect earrings! Very fast shipping. Will buy from seller again.
2,So cute; shipped promptly. Thanks so much!
2,Beautiful but its hard to make them tight enough to fully stay on my ear as a climber. I wanted to wear these every day and not take them off but after a few days wear there is some tarnishing on the backs.
2,These climbers hold onto my ear and stay in place all day. They are very thin so they are even harder to keep track of than other earrings.
2,"very delicate, fast shipping. Thank you!"
2,"Love it, every time I lose one I have to buy more."
2,Best earrings! They stay on my ears and I can't even feel them.
2,Great product and fast shipping!
2,Bought these as a Christmas gift for my sister.  She loved them!
2,"It was beautiful, but was just a bit big for my ears and didn’t seem to fit well. Mostly a difference of expectation though!"
2,"Earring fell out numerous times. After 3 days, and even after adding my own backs, I lost one. They refunded the cost of one earring but I found their customer service to be impersonal and uncaring. Disappointed and not worth the price."
2,"Wonderful! They fit securely, are very lightweight, and so amazingly unique! These were just what I was looking for! :)"
2,"The item shipped really quickly! I love them, they're really detailed!"
2,"I'm so happy with these earrings, they are absolutely stunning!!"
2,I love them to bits ! delivery was on time & nicely wrapped. Will definitely buy from this seller again !
2,I love them!!! I love this style so much!!!! Great job!!!!!
2,Such a beautiful well crafted earring. It’s very comfortable to wear and sits nicely on the ear. I absolutely love it!
2,"The earrings are lovely, very detailed work, and they look amazing on!"
2,"Stunning detail, just an absolutely gorgeous piece!! Worth every penny, nickel, quarter and dime."
2,"They look REALLY gorgeous, but for some reason they won't stay ""up"" on one of my ears. :("
2,so glad u recommended the bend. I LOVE THEM
2,"Very pretty, perfect size, excellent shipping!"
2,They are awesome ! Got them a lot quicker than I thought. Thanks so much!
2,"Arrived in great condition! I have to do some adjusting to get them to stay up the way I want them to sit, but it's not a big issue. Still beautiful earrings and lighter than expected! I wore them to go see Thor and completely forgot I was wearing earrings!"
2,Earrings arrived quickly and were beautifully wrapped :-) Will definitely shop here again.
2,"super cute and comfortable! they don't stay put when I try to wear them across my ear like the model (they stick out and down a little), so I just wear them vertically. I still love them, giving 4 instead of 5 stars because they didn't turn out to be what I thought they were going to... but still recommend!!!"
2,Absolutely beautiful earrings and fast shipping! Thank you so much! (and sorry this feedback took so long..)
2,Awesome! Thank you!!
2,I hope I will be one with these earrings in Russia :)
2,"I get compliments on these earrings all the time because of how striking and sharp they look. but they are heavier than average earrings and it took some time before my ears got used to them. The part of the earring that pierces through your lobes is (too) short for the backing of the earring, and it is located on the wider part of the wing design, so that the earring kind of hangs heavy on the bottom, which makes it a bit awkward to wear. Contrary to how it's advertised, because of the unequal weight distribution on either end of the wing design, you cannot wear the earrings like Rihanna wore hers (i.e. with the slimmer end of the wings pointing upwards). Overall, I am satisfied with the product and the price. It is a good find."
2,Love these earrings with fast delivery.
2,Awesome:)) I get lots of compliments :)
2,Great to work with. Great Earrings
2,"These earring are very pretty! They look really cool when wearing them up, or down and are comfy."
2,AMAZING! Thanks so much.
2,A very cute accessory that has an edge to it. It took a little while for it to arrive.
2,Very lightweight to wear & very detailed - great everyday earrings.
2,Awesome! Exactly what I was looking for!
2,Thank you! Lovely earrings :)
2,The earrings are perfect. I would buy from this seller again.
2,"Gorgeous earrings, great service and swift delivery."
2,"Love seller's style.  Unfortunately, I don't wear these as often as I'd like because I was under the impression they would sit upright on my ear.  After a little tweaking and bending they just don't fit my ear right.  So I can only wear them down, which gives them a cool edgy rocker feel."
2,"Awesome, she loved them! Thanks!"
2,"These beautiful earings are much bigger than I expected and the post doesn't seem to be in the bright place and they therefore do not sit upright on your ear, but stick out a little like Spock ears. They are quite solid and I don't think they look quite right pointing down. I am going to make them into a brooch or a necklace instead."
2,very cute and seller is really nice <3
2,"Awesome earrings :). My friend is going to love them as a her b-day gift. Also, they arrived quicker than I previously thought."
2,These earrings hang down and I thought they would look different but still nice
2,"The earring themselves are beautiful, but there's no way they stay up. I'm actually quite disappointed and will give them away. :("
2,Fast shipping (arrived in the 6 day bracket after shipping notice) but I don't really like these earrings as much as I thought I would. They look very luxurious in the pictures but they seem quite dull in real life. Little disappointing for the $18 price tag.
2,"The wings don't stay in place. They droop down. I was really looking forward to wearing these, but was disappointed."
2,"Bad quality, absolutely poor crap, already broken when they arrived and these wing earrings can not be put on the ears, too heavy and cheap. Don't make the same mistake as me and buy this crap."
2,"Love it! It's a little bit loose and gets facing weird directions but of course it does. It's gorgeous, exactly what I wanted!"
2,Beautiful piece. Thank you so much.
2,"very nice piece but too thick of a piercing neck on the earring for my cartilage hole, need to force stretch the hole to fit this piece."
2,The earrings took two weeks to arrive. It was totally okay it's understandable because I ordered it on the 22nd of December. The earrings are simple and beautiful. I definitely needed a youtube video to help me put them on. After viewing the video it takes you seconds to put them on. Totally worth the money! Must by
2,"Love it! got great compliments already from the first day I put it on! FYI, must read and understand the size of the item. I was anticipating a little bigger. Picture can be deceiving, but I'm absolutely satisfied with my purchase."
2,Went perfectly with my gold dress! Made it in plenty of time for my event.
2,"I love this earrings! They’re very unique and I love to wear them! It’s a new style! The seller is a wonderful and helpful person. Even though there were some difficulties with shipping, she was very active & did everything to make me get my oder. Thank you so much BenittaMoko! ❤️"
2,"Wundervoll und hochwertig verarbeitet, ein toller diskreter aber raffinierter Hingucker. Es ist sehr angenehm zu tragen und ich bin total begeistert =)"
2,i LOVE my hammered gold earrings! the first crawlers that actually stay put and i get compliments everywhere i go!
2,Love these earrings and they came really quickly :) I get compliments on these all the time
2,Love how subtle these are.
2,Love love
2,"Ich liebe meine neuen Ohrringe!!!
Sehen total edel aus und lassen sich toll tragen. Sind ganz leicht, nicht spürbar und gut verarbeitet."
2,Love them!
2,"I previously posted that I couldn't get the earrings to stay in place, but I was pretty sure it was me and not the earrings. I was right! I tried them again today, and they're staying in place just fine. I love them! 

Arrived fast, and they're lovely, but I just can't get them to rest in my ear the way they do in the photos. I wear them pointing down instead, and am happy with them, but wish I could get them to stay put long-wise. I'm pretty sure it's due to the shape of my ears / user error, though, and not the earrings themselves. :)"
2,These are super comfortable and fashionable with any type of outfit. I get compliments each time I wear them ☺️
2,Absolutely love these earrings! My favorite pair to wear. Always get compliments. Thank you!
2,"Gorgeous, simple, golden goddess ???"
2,My favorite
2,C'est le deuxième que j'achète et je l'adore! Simple original et élégant!
2,They're so beautiful! I love them!!
2,Beautiful thank You 🙏
2,"Boucles d'oreilles très belles. 
Mais l'envoie a été très long.... Un peu moins d'un mois. Et donc pas arrivé à temps pour les fêtes de Noël..."
2,I really love these! They're my new favourite earrings. They fit comfortably as well. Highly recommended!
2,Perfect!!!
2,"I absolutely love these earrings. I have received so many compliments about how they are ""so you.""  I never like wearing earrings because they usually are heavy on my ears or poke my head behind my ears. Most earrings irritate my skin, but these don't. These ones are light weight and lay in my ear naturally. i cant even feel them. I could sleep in them! Thank you, i will definitely be back!"
2,I love them! They look beautiful and understated.
2,"I love these earrings, so pretty and individual. Thank you 😊"
2,"Lovely pieces, beautifully packed and easy yo wear with everything!!!"
2,"Magnifique ! Parfait. Bel emballage, belle qualité !"
2,Love Love Love IT! Fits perfect!
2,"I love these! I just wish they stayed a little bit firmer on my ears, but I think that’s the nature of an ear climber."
2,Lovely!
2,Super schön! Kann ich nur weiter empfehlen
2,Love these! Goes with all sorts of outfits and have received loads of compliments. Thank you!
2,So so so happy! I got them in the mail a week ago and have worn them 4 times already. Everytime I wear them I get compliments!! Great quality! Will be purchasing from this shop again!
2,Just gorgeous! perfect size and easy to wear. I am enjoying them a lot.
2,Beautiful ear crawlers. Would recommend this seller!
2,I requested it to be a little shorter to fit my ear better and it looks great! Love it.
2,I love these. So dainty and unique. Thank you!
2,"unique, classy and wearable.  I get complements daily on these earrings.  great design."
2,"Took a while to get there but it was stipulated in the item description so no surprise ! The earrings are just perfect, and they came in a lovely tiny box. Many thanks :)"
2,Beautifully made and fits my ears perfectly! Also came is the specified shipping time.
2,"I am very satisfied with this shopping, i think this is coolest ear climbers ever! 
Thank you!"
2,Love these ear climbers
2,Unique and gorgeous. I love these ear climbers!
2,These earrings really catch the light.  They are stunning!  My daughter has a pair of these earrings.  The way these earrings catch the light made me want a pair too!
2,Super fin et si joli! Une merveille!
2,"Love the way these look, however they don't clamp onto ear very well. Could be the design of my ears!"
2,SUPER CUTE! It arrived within time frame.I would definitely recommend this piece easy to put on and comfortable.
2,These are so beautiful and lightweight
2,"Génial et parfait, merci !!!"
2,"I almost never take the time to write reviews, but had to make an exception because I LOVE these earrings!
They fit snugly on my ear and do not slip around at all, but also don't pinch and are so comfortable that I often forget to take them off before bed. They are also are even prettier and daintier in person and I get tons of compliments. I also have very sensitive skin and the metal doesn't irritate it at all.
I wear them almost every day-- cannot recommend enough :)"
2,"These are beautiful and well made, but I found them a little long for my petite ears. Be careful to measure your lobes when ordering climbers, and adjust if you need to find something smaller!"
2,"Es hat alles super geklappt, vielen Dank!!
Die Ohrklemme ist sehr fein verarbeitet und sieht sehr schön aus!!"
2,Sehr schöner Ohring! Schnelle Lieferung!
2,"Absolutely beautiful and unique earrings, love them!"
2,"Ordered these with the cuffs...this one fits my ear a little awkwardly, but I think it's just the shape of my ear. Loved both of these products! Show your support!"
2,Perfect!! Thank you!
2,So beautiful and unique... thank you!
2,Great quality! This is my third pair purchased (one for myself and two as gifts)! Ships quicker than expected.

2,Beautiful Earwear!! Really happy with them
2,Beautiful! I like them a lot
2,"Beautiful earrings, exactly as shown. A great present. Would certainly buy again."
2,Very simple and minimalist. Stays the way it's supposed to most of the time if I'm not touching it. Have gotten sevral compliments but I love it for the tiny detail and slight shininess it creates.
2,Items are exactly as described and stay in place very well. Really beautiful pieces!!
2,¡Me encantaron los aretes! Súper delicados y edgy a la vez.
2,"I love these crawlers. I did have to bend the back a bit, because they were making my ears hurt, but it was very easy to do. I got these by the recommendation of Sharleen Joynt and I’m very happy with my purchase."
2,"envoi trés soigné, le bijou est superbe"
2,Just as pictured. Love them!
2,Everyone keeps asking about them - they're so special!
2,"Très jolies boucles d'oreilles, tout à fait conforme à la photo, très bon rapport qualité / prix !"
2,"These earrings are edgy and everyday at the same time. A little hard to get in the first time, but well worth the effort!"
2,"Conforme aux photos, discret et élégant"
2,Great project and love wearing!!
2,Arrivé rapidement et très jolies boucles d'oreille
2,Sehr schöne Ohrringe! Vielen Dank
2,"My ears are too small , they don't fit quite well. They also rusted on me after the second use."
2,Very cute! Happy with purchase
2,"Really nice earrings, fit perfectly and impress around me :)"
2,Purchased this item in both gold & silver and I love it.  Came in mail very quickly.  Will purchase again from this seller
2,Really beautyful errings - Ilove them.
2,Very cute. loved the ear climbers!
2,Really beautiful .. Thank you.. Will recommend this store
2,These earrings are beautiful and well made.
2,These are beautiful earrings and arrived within the projected time. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because they keep sliding down off my ears every 15ish minutes. It's a bit frustrating. But I have small lobes in length and thickness so this probably wouldn't be a concern for most.
2,"The package took 32 days to arrive to my home.  I like the hammered look of the earrings.  The earrings seem like shaped wire, they are flexible which I did not expect.  The earrings ""loosen"" and because they do not fit my ear perfectly I need to keep adjusting them throughout the day. The ends slide down and stick off my ear.  Of course everyone's ears are not shaped the same but I did not forsee this happening.

I do get lots of compliments and they are a very unique idea, but I could have hammered some wire myself for less than $30."
2,LOVE!! Going to buy more!
2,"attention à la forme de vos oreilles 
en tout cas service serieux livraison ok"
2,Yes it shipped on time and love the earrings
2,Very nice and cool! Looks great.
2,"Everything fine! Beautiful earrings, thank you!"
2,"Stunning ear cuffs. Getting lots of compliments when wearing them, the only complaint is that they don’t stay in place very well and I frequently have to check that they are still in place."
2,Perfect article! Received on time and looks beautiful. Thank you!
2,Look as great as on the photo. Fast delivery.
2,This seller is very helpful
2,"simple, different. good quality and interesting"
2,Son originalité + qualité matière
2,"Shipped earlier than expected. Lovely, lovely, thank you."
2,"very pretty earrings, good quality"
2,"Beautiful earrings! I was a bit worried about how these would feel, but they are very comfortable and don't budge in my ears."
2,"These arrived right on time, exactly as pictured, and with the ideal amount of pinch.  (Effective, but not painful.)"
2,I love how delicate they are but my only complaint is the part of the earring that sits through my ear is very short so the earrings make my ears very sore.  I only wore them for a few hours and when I took them out the holes where my ears are pierced were red and swollen.  I'll still try to wear them but only for a very short period of time.
2,"Very delicate and pretty, kind of painful to wear for too long"
2,Material is thinner than it looks.
2,"Still waiting for product, received email from seller, will edit when I receive package- don't know how to delete a review."
2,I didnt receive my item yet.
2,"I love them so much; I didn't understand how to put them on at first, but it took me less than 2 minutes. If they feel loose, I can just squeeze them a bit. I would definitely buy more, plus they came in the cutest little corkscrew bottle ❤️"
2,"My new favorite. I love looking at the moon, I always appreciate it whenever I see it...and this ear climber design really captured the phases. The earrings are just so lovely. I'm really happy I found it from Arajera."
2,"SO so cute! High quality too! I love them so much, Thank you!!"
2,"OBSESSED with these and the pretty little glass jar they came in, so dainty and elegant!"
2,"Great communication from the seller who also provided tracking number. And, while shipping took some time as was noted in description, the ear climbers arrived safely in a cute small cork bottle inside a padded envelope, along with a care card. Simply over the moon for these! Flawless craftsmanship and they fit me perfectly! I've never owned any that were complimented on nearly as much as ones from Ara. She is my favorite person to purchase ear climbers from. I'm once again very pleased and appreciative!"
2,The ear pins are very unusual.I love them and they were worth the wait. I have them on right now.
2,I love them!!!
2,"I gave Ara so much stress for switching address from NY to Japan.
She was so patient and tried so hard to match my needs.
I finally got items while I was in Japan and I was able to give to my sister. And she loves it.  Thank you so much!"
2,"Just arrived, in cute little vile to keep them safe. Good quality earrings, slightly fiddley to get them in at first but once got the hang of them all fine, thank you xx xx"
2,I've been looking for ear climbers for a while and these are perfect!
2,"My package arrived today and it's exactly what I expected!! The earrings are easy to put in. While they represent the moon, they are also perfect for the upcoming North American solar eclipse. Thank you!!!"
2,"Omg.... these earrings are so unique, i couldn't be happier@"
2,These ear climbers are absolutely beautiful. And I can tell that they're quality. Thanks! :)
2,Love them!
2,"Love these earrings! I am a science nerd, so they are perfect!"
2,I absolutely adore this shop. I’ve ordered several times (because I’m prone to always and forever losing my earrings lol) and I would highly recommend them.
2,What beautiful earrings! They look lovely on and are just the perfect size. I loved the little glass bottle they came in too! I'm already planning a second order. :)
2,Just got these. 5 stars alone for packaging in an adorable little glass bottle; perfect as I always seem to lose one earring. Other sellers should take note on their packaging! Earrings look just as advertised.
2,THESE ARE MY NEW FAVORITE EARRINGS IN THE WHOLE WORLD OMG
2,"I get so many compliments on these earrings. I love that I can bend the silver to the shape of my ear. I ordered the ones with moonstone, and it’s a beautiful touch"
2,"Shipping took a while cause it’s international, but I’ve gotten tons of compliments on these!"
2,"They are perfect!! I absolutely love them, plus very well packaged and cutely, good seller communication and shipping good as well."
2,I'm obsessed with these earrings. Just beautiful and so unique.
2,These earrings are super cute and I get lots of compliments on them
2,"I recently purchased this item.  As promised after being notified that they had been shipped, I received in weeks.  They are absolutely gorgeous.  Beautiful work, very light, and easy to put on.  I love them!"
2,"Beautiful! Thank you, it's perfect!"
2,PERFECT!!!!!  Exactly what I wanted!!!!!  The short wait for production was well worth it and the gift packaging is VERY cute!
2,"The earrings are well worth the wait! They are just lovely. My only small issue: one back wire was somewhat rough. I was able to scratch off some silver ""splinters"" that stuck out with my fingernail, but this hasn't proven a problem at all, even with daily wear."
2,I love them. These are my first ear climbers and I'll doubt they will be the last. Thanks!
2,Another beautiful set of earrings. I love the moon theme. These are also well made and stay put on my ear.
2,I love these earrings! They are SO beautiful! I definitely will be purchasing more items! Thank you so much!
2,Absolutely beautiful!!
2,Worth the wait! My earrings just arrived today and I love them! Thank uou!

2,"Beautiful, everything I wanted.  So comfortable I sleep in them, no issues with them staying on my ears at all.  I may have to buy the moonstone versions!"
2,These are beautiful!! The shipping takes time but well worth it. I have received so many compliments.
2,"gorgeous! love these so so much, they fall out sometimes but nothing a back cant fix"
2,"1. The earrings are lovely.
2. They came delivered in a tiny glass bottle which is adorable and great."
2,These are a gift and I know she will be thrilled with them. More gorgeous in person than in the photo. It didn’t take long to get them either. Thank You!
2,"I love these so much, cannot wait to wear them. Gorgeous cute little bottled packaging too!"
2,I love the earrings worth the wait
2,I love everything about these ear-rings. Very cute and a perfect size. Love them x
2,These climbers came promptly and have been admired every time I have worn them. I made a very slight adjustment to the end of the wire at the back to make them more comfortable and easier to put on. They came very safely packaged and in a beautiful little jar which would make them a very special gift (in this case for me!)
2,Earrings are perfect! They are a little hard to put on but once you figure it out they are so cute! I've gotten tons of compliments.
2,"Very elegant and also fun. Great quality! I'll be wearing this for a long time. :>
Shipping was prompt, and the package arrived from overseas faster than I had hoped."
2,"Absolutely beautiful ear climber, I love it."
2,I love the style of this ear climber.  My lobes are rather small so I have had difficulty getting them to stay put.  They are lovely and I will continue to work with them to get them to sit correctly.  The items arrived in good time and well packaged.
2,"I love them! Was surprised at how “sturdy” they seem, I think they will last a long time"
2,Amazing service and Fantastic earrings have ordered from this seller several times and quality of earrings is great and love the customer service any issues they are happy to help and very responsive. Highly recommend this seller and their products :)
2,These are beautiful! I get so many compliments on them!

2,"Bought these earrings for my daughter and she loves them! Very well made, super cute, great packaging! Thank you, arajera!"
2,"These weren't working for me because they were too big for my ears. The seller worked with me to find a way to make them fit. She seemed that she would have been willing to do whatever it would have taken to please me and make it right. I would feel comfortable working with her. Now that they fit, I love them."
2,"Спасибо, красивые серьги, быстрая доставка! Thank you, beautiful earrings, fast delivery!"

Neil"
2,"cute delicate and light, and love the little glass bottle they came in!"
2,beautiful earrings! i just love these!
2,"Shipping was a bit of a disaster, through no fault of the seller though. Once it reached the country of destination, I stopped getting updates. In total, it took about four weeks for the item to arrive. 

The item itself is really cute. They stay on really well and look really great! I would purchase this item again."
2,"These are lovely, and I'm very happy with them. Thank you so much."
2,I like them very much but the earrings took forever (well over 6 weeks) to arrive inspite of the warning that she was away. When I contacted her about tracking them she said tracking was my issue. So no tracking process was in place from her end.
2,"Beautiful, fits nicely, lovely item. Much appreciated!"
2,Gorgeous earrings! Lots of compliments and I bought a pair for a friend who also loves them. Yay!
2,Beautiful unique earrings! So happy with them!

2,"Cute as can be, just as expected.  Thank you!"
2,The earrings are beautiful!!
2,"Beautiful and great quality, only thing is that they don’t stay in place on the earlobe, well at least not mine"

2,Good earring. Thank you!
2,Broke after the first wear. Super disappointed.
2,Item is as described but came out more expensive than I realized due to conversions. The original posting was in USD I believe - not sure I would have spent this much had I known.
2,Easy to put on and comfortable. The earring stays in place.
2,I ordered these earrings  back in October and have not recieved them.  I contacted the seller to inquire and was told that something went wrong with everything in that shipment and they hope I recieve the item I purchased. I replied asking what my options are over a week ago and the seller has yet to respond. I would like to cancel/ refund for the purchase but im not sure how when the seller won't respond back
2,"I have, to date, still not even received my order.  When I inquired with the shop I was told they can do nothing and to contact the post office.  The post office has nothing.  I'm at a loss here.  I paid my money and did not receive anything for it.  I wish I were able to say something good here and I'm truly disappointed I did not get my order.  When I asked about a refund I was again told to check with the post office.  Next step, formal complaint with Etsy."
2,"These arrived quickly, are packaged well, and look great!"
2,I just wish the hook could be a bigger size because it’s kind of small on my ear
2,It was a great gift and looked exactly like the picture. Would buy again! The gift box add on is great as well.
2,This arrived quickly and looks amazing - thanks!
2,This arrived very quickly and is very nice
2,Delicate & beautiful! Shipped on time! My bridesmaids love them!
2,"Got these for me and my girls for the wedding, they are perfect! Got them in rose gold and silver and they are so pretty and light."
2,"These are the second pair of ear crawlers I have purchased. After the quality and comfort of the first I knew I wanted another pair. They are as beautiful in person. This seller has amazing things. If you’re considering buying, you should, you won’t be disappointed!"
4,These are so cute! Such a statement piece. I am not big on giant hoops or gaudy jewelry. These are so nice and elegant they go with everything!
4,I love love love these earrings! Fast shipping ❤
4,"These earrings are so cute. I have two earring holes and I can put them in either one. If you bend it a little bit when it's in your ear it'll stay on and not slip. Great design, true to size."
4,"Absolutely beautiful earrings!  So dainty and sweet.  Fast shipping, too!  Thank you!!"
4,My fancy version of these (I bought two pairs). I would gladly buy from this shop again
4,it's pretty! the rose gold kind of blends into my skin tone so i wish i got the silver one instead
4,"The earrings are small and dainty, just my style.  I love them.  Shop owner was a pleasure to work with.  Will definitely shop here again."
4,I love love love these earings!
4,I just received these and love how it looks!! Super fast shipping too. I'm ready for more!
4,"These are just so lovely! Delicate & beautiful, looks just like the photo. I bought these as a gift & want to buy another for myself."
4,Item exactly as pictured. I received multiple compliments on these when I wore them. They are a little fragile but gorgeous!
4,"So pretty, I love them."
4,These earrings are just as beautiful as you imagine them to be!
4,"These are very nice & more on the dainty side than some ""crawler"" style earrings which is great for someone with small ears like myself. I did struggle to get them in at first with the unique angle of the post but once in they were light & comfortable to wear. Also the gold plating is a nicer more natural gold look than a lot of costume jewelry I've received from other sellers on this site."
4,"These are so beautiful and elegant and very sweet, I will wear them often and with everything!  I received them quickly after ordering."
4,I requested an address change for my order and Lucy was very accommodating. The earrings themselves are gorgeous.
4,Lovely earrings - nicely packed in cloth bag ready for gifting (except you may like to keep them as earrings are so pretty :)
4,Beautiful design. I love them!
4,"Earrings came in earlier than expected!
Made out of great quality &  look really nice up close."
4,Absolutely gorgeous! Will be ordering more for my bridesmaids!
4,"Love them, thank you!"
4,So nice and  easy to wear. Can wear casually or with a nicer outfit and they stay in place...very pleased!
4,This earrings are for my wedding and I love it. Good quality and fast shipping.
4,I got these earrings for my wedding and they came exactly as pictured—they’re beautiful!
4,These earrings are so beautiful!
4,"Super pretty, thanks so much!"
4,Perfect! Exactly as described and beautiful.
4,Arrived quickly & look absolutely stunning!
4,"sehr fein, chic passt zu jede Styl"
4,Very delicate and pretty
4,"Beautiful, very happy with product!"
4,These earrings are beautiful and I have purchased a few before for myself and as gifts. Thank you!💛
4,Thank you! Serious transaction and earings beautiful and delicate ;)
4,Beautiful earrings!  Fast shipping and an easy exchange when I accidentally ordered the wrong item.
4,"I received these earrings very quickly, and they are gorgeous!"
4,So beautiful! I can’t wait to wear these on my wedding day.
4,Very pretty and delicate earrings. Came very quickly and were in tiny mesh bags that I thought were very nice.
4,"Really beautiful, exactly as pictured!"
4,Lovely and elegant. Very happy with purchase
4,They are beautiful. Can’t wait to give them as a gift.
4,"Beautiful earrings, excellent for that special occasion."
4,High quality earrings that stay put throughout the day. They don't irritate my sensitive ears either which is a huge plus.
4,"Got here quick, exactly as pictured."
4,Very nice earrings! Great gift for the holidays
4,Fits my earlobe but not my upper ear
4,"Customer service is very terrible. I contacted regarding a return and I never got a reply. Moreover, the earrings are mismatched, poor quality and it is not Nickle free as claimed. These earrings are as cheap as once you can get for $5."
4,This set is beautiful!! I got the right ear climber and the left as the standard earring. I cannot wait to wear these on my wedding day! The ear climber cuff/clip has this thing in the back to help tighten it to the desired fit which is awesome. It also came with a Swarovski Crystal ID number which was super nice. Do not hesitate to buy!! If I could put pictures of both earrings on I would but I only seem to be able to upload one so the picture is of the rose gold ear climber!!
4,"I want to start off by saying these earrings are gorgeous, exactly as described/photographed. 

Unfortunately, there were two major downsides: 
#1) They took 5 weeks to get here and while the seller was accommodating and sympathetic to my pre-wedding freak out, I was genuinely surprised at the length of time and was my ONLY overseas Etsy purchase that took that long (everything else was 2-3 weeks). 
#2) They were extremely uncomfortable and I had to pull them off almost immediately due to painful pinching. I thought maybe I had them on wrong and had two of my bridesmaids check them...nope, on correctly. Not sure what the deal was there, I don’t have robust ears by any means and they just hurt. Really a bummer to spend this much money and not be able to ever wear them, let alone for the purpose I purchased them."
4,"I have been looking for earrings for my bridesmaids.  It's been hard to find something that fits my ""vision.""  I came across Rebekas page and absolutely fell in love with her designs!  I found these earring just in hopes they would work.  They took a few weeks to come in, but TOTALLY worth the wait!  Nothing was damaged, and they were packed with care.  When I opened the box that held the earrings I melted!  They look even better than the pictures!  I took them outside in the natural sunlight, and all I can say is ""WOW!""  Now that I know they are EXACTLY what I am looking for...I will be ordering 3 more for the remaining bridesmaids!  Her work is beautiful and detailed.  Truly, some of the most beautiful pieces of jewelry I have seen in a long time!  THANK YOU!!!!"
4,These earrings were absolutely stunning. Well worth the money. I wore them on my wedding day and they matched my dress perfectly and looked and felt expensive. Photographed well and I got lots of compliments!
4,"Once again, Rebekas work was AMAZING!  I did end up purchasing 3 other large pairs for my bridesmaids...and I also needed something for my junior bridesmaid.  She made the earrings for my junior bridesmaid 100% IDENTICAL to my bridesmaid, just in a smaller size. and in a clip on since she does not have pierced ears. 
 Shipping was very quick.  Seriously, I cannot wait to recommend her to other friends and family member for special events in the future.  PLEASE SUPPORT HER BUSINESS!"
4,Rebeka was so helpful and worked with me to meld two of her signature pieces into my very own earring. They are so perfect! Exactly what I wanted-great quality. Can’t wait to wear them on my big day. It’s the perfect blend of elegance and my personality! Thank you thank you!!
4,"Love this Carnelian ring which Rebeka made for me. Carnelian is my birth stone and is associated with vitality, motivation and success. I searched several shops before choosing Rebeka Jewelry. The simple and minimal design style for this historically ancient gemstone suits me best for this ring. Very friendly experience to correspond in Israel with her! Happy. :)"
4,These are BEAUTIFUL! I bought them for my wedding because I wanted a pop of color but struggled finding something that didn't look cheap.  These were absolutely perfect and the perfect size!
4,I love my new ring!! I asked for a pink opal and it’s beautiful especially in the sun. Excellent quality and workmanship. The pictures don’t do it justice. It’s very elegant and sparkling. It took 20 days to receive it but it is worth the wait. I will be shopping here again.
4,The jewelry I ordered was more beautiful in person and I couldn’t be happier to wear it on my wedding day
4,Hey! I got my jewelleries from Rebeka and I have to say I feel like a Queen now! She did just what I wanted. When I opened my boxes and saw the sparkle and shine from the jewelleries I couldnt believe my eyes. Thank you Rebeka💝
4,"This was a custom order. As a return customer, Rebecca worked with me on an idea of different colored stones around the sides.  The result was more lovelier than I could have imaged and I am happily wearing them today!"
4,"Very beautiful earrings! 🥰 I am so in love with these! ♥️ These earrings are the perfect accessory for my wedding dress. Very elegant,  classic and very sparkly 😌😌 Seller is very flexible and accommodated all my personalization requests and it turned out exactly how I wanted it to be. I recommend this seller to everyone I know ♥️"
4,"These are so cool looking, I can’t wait to wear them!! They are a little on the heavy side so I probably will wear them only for the reception (not the ceremony) but they are going to look SO GOOD with my leather jacket! Just an FYI these are glamorous enough that you probably don’t need a necklace with them!"
4,Beautiful craftsmanship! Simple and elegant. I’m very happy with this piece!
4,"I totally love this sweet little ring!  It’s well-made, super comfortable and exactly what I was hoping for—a simple, minimalist style that goes well with other “statement” rings."
4,"Absolutely stunning, even better in person! They arrived really quickly, too. Thank you!"
4,"Absolutely stunning, even better in person! They arrived really quickly, too. Thank you!"
4,"These earrings are beautiful and elegant! They are versatile and can be worn from casual to very dressy. They’re bold, but definitely not gaudy. In addition, they’re comfortable to wear. I purchased the rose gold/tone color. The color is not a deep rose gold-tone color. It is more of the color of genuine rose gold. I compared it to a genuine rose gold ring that I have. The color might not be as visible in the picture; But, it is a little more visible in person and in the reflection of light."
4,gorgeous! looks great as a pair (one on each ear) and looks great with the crawler on one ear depending on the hairdo- very very happy with the purchase of both!!!!!!!
4,"Absolutely 💯 beautiful 😍 and breathtaking!! I absolutely love it 😀!! Great communication 👏 and got here fast 👌!! Im impressed, ty again Rebecka!! Ur awesome!!"

4,"Pretty ring, was way too big but I bought a ring guard for $10 and it fits great now. Shipping took forever but that’s expected because of covid"
4,"Absolutely stunning! Just as the photo shows. The item was shipped immediately after I placed my order however, the shipping did take longer due to COVID (I did not choose expedited shipping.) Rebeka was very responsive to all of my messages and very easy to work with. Highly recommend!"
4,"The earrings arrived today, on schedule for my sister's birthday.  She LOVES them.  She said they are a rich color and very pretty.  Thanks for your help getting the order there quickly.  I'll look for your products again--for me!
Lynn Scheuerle"
4,These are beautiful and just as pictured

4,Absolutely  gorgeous. I just love them!
4,"The red coral earrings are lovely.  The colors within the stones are gorgeous and well illustrated by the photos provided on Etsy by Rebeka.  The earrings measure roughly 1"" x 3/4"" (25mm x 19mm) -- the size is again well illustrated by the photo provided by Rebeka.  The earrings arrived in a timely manner -- I certainly recommend doing business with Rebeka."
4,"this is so huge - i am impressed, love it ."

4,"I love them. They look exclusive, are the right color. Thank you. Just what i was looking for."
4,"This item is lovely.  The shop stated the piece was shipped out during the week, only when I inquired as to why the tracking wasn’t updating, I found out it was not shipped and was shipped almost a week later."
4,"So beautiful, they look perfect"
4,Beautiful little earrings! I gifted these to my Mom for Christmas and she loves them! The backings that came with them were too large and wouldn't stay snug but besides that they are perfect.
4,"Just received my earrings.
I'm so excited. It's even nicer than the picture on display. I highly recommend her and will certainly buy from her again.

Thank you so much!"
4,They are amazing ! Very good quality and very chic !
4,"Ich habe diese Ohrringe bis heute ( 1 Monat nach der Bestellung) noch nicht erhalten und kann sie deshalb nur nach der Wartezeit beurteilen, die ich zu lang finde."
4,The necklace was exactly as described! Shipping was fast as agreed upon when contacting the seller beforehand.
4,"My ring is beautiful very well made, took a bit longer to arrive because of the pandemic, which is to be expected! I highly recommend Rebeka's craftmanship , she is a very skilled jeweler! ;) Now I have a little piece of Israel on my finger!! Love it!! God bless everyone!! Stay safe world!!"

4,Stunning! I Love and recommend this company.
4,"I love these earrings.  I have been wearing them everyday since I received them, even in this time of Covid.  I wear them in the evening when my husband and I are playing Scrabble and having happy hour outside. They're bright and noticeable without being gawdy.  They look just like the photo."
4,"Absolutely stunning. I purchased several items from Rebekajewelry, she is the best."
4,love the color! honestly gorgeous
4,dazzling very well made and professionally set. Wife loves it. Statement Ring.
4,Beautiful earrings. You can tell they use quality crystals to make them because they shine beautifully. I cant wait to wear these for my wedding in February.
4,"Shipping took a little longer than expected, and given the price, the quality is a little lower than I anticipated - it’s very lightweight. However they are otherwise exactly as pictured and will look very pretty on my wedding day and in photos. Customer service was very quick and Rebeka was very kind and friendly, as well."
4,Found these earrings for my mother she loved them. Exactly her style and looked exactly as advertised. Beautiful quality!
4,"The necklace itself is beautiful. The corrected matching earrings I received as a gift for my wedding are beautiful as well. 
UPDATED REVIEW: The customer service is something less than desirable, it was not until after my initial review that she offered to pay for the return shipping for a manufacturing error that was originally on her end. However, Rebeka did pay back the return shipping & gave me a discount code for a future purchase."
4,"I received my ear-rings and they were beautiful.  I am really happy with them, they are a true colour and a perfect size.  I can’t wait to wear them to my sons wedding."
4,BEAUTIFUL!! The very best earrings I have EVER purchased on Etsy. Truly stunning. Fast shipping and great communication. Very elegant.
4,The earrings I bought from this shop are so beautiful and I can’t wait to wear them on my wedding day!
4,This is an exquisite piece of jewelry. You can tell there was a lot of love when it was made. Very satisfied
4,"Beautiful necklace, seller observed length request."
4,This necklace is perfect. The beautiful eilat stone surrounded by silver is large enough for a tall man (or women) to wear and others' will see it. The chain is a comfortable length and sparkles. It also has an easy to open clasp. A terrific purchase.
4,These earrings are nice...the montana blue color is beautiful.
4,"These earrings are exactly as pictured. Great quality, but still light so they will not feel uncomfortable if worn for long periods of time. I love the closed hook as well. Can’t wait to wear them at my wedding!"
4,"Beautiful item- Seller resolved issue with missed notes on sizing after contact. 
Pendant was slightly smaller than listed but beautiful all the same.
Beware customs charges if ordering from the UK!"
4,"Ordered this for my wedding day necklace and I am super disappointed. One of my colors is blush and I was very excited for the blush center stone, however the stone looks like a brown colored gemstone."
4,The ear cuff is beautiful! It's exactly as described and arrived on-time.
4,"Beautiful, dramatic and the colors in the stones are stunning."
4,Vraiment très beau je l'aime beaucoup
4,These are stunning. So excited to wear them on my wedding day.
4,It’s so beautiful n perfect as shown in the picture
4,This ring is beautiful. Excellent quality. The seller shipped it in a timely manner and tracking was provided. I would definitely purchase from seller again.
4,It’s perfect. Very cute!
4,Great quality beautiful ring I am very happy with my purchase.
4,WOW!!! I LOVE these earrings. They go perfect with my wedding dress.
4,"I really was excited about this piece, as I had order several pieces prior.  The wrong piece was shipped even though the instructions were followed to add a message for specifics.  It took days for the shop to answer questions to correct the error.  Then, the item was received after I needed it.
I do like the pieces; hopefully, communication will get better."
4,Beautiful necklace that is unique!
4,Item has still not arrived. Have waited a month now. On top of that had to pay extra £24 for customs charge which was not displayed in advert.
4,"Bonjour, 
Superbe création, colis arrivé ce mercredi en excellent état dans un écrin magnifique.
Merci à très vite"
4,"The shipping took longer than expected, but they finally arrived. Beautiful earrings. I can't wait to wear them for my wedding day!"
4,"Such a beautiful piece, super fast shipping, great customer service.  DON'T hesitate to purchase!"
4,Nice product. As we expected!
4,Love the earrings great quality. Thanks
4,Me han gustado mucho los pendientes verdes. Son muy bonitos y me gusta el contraste en los dos tonos de verde.
4,Didn't look like pictures. It's more in your fsve gold. S it needed woul be glitter...😂
4,Magnifiques boucles d'oreilles ! Joli cristal
4,"Beautiful jewellery, amazing colour. Speedy delivery"
4,Exactly as pictured. It’s beautiful; delicate and understated. It will be a perfect gift for my maid of honor!
4,"it’s beautiful, my wife loved it!"
4,The bracelet is exactly as described. It arrived on-time and goes beautifully with my other pieces.
4,Looks just same on the picture.
4,Communication and earrings are great. Delivery was quite slow :)
4,Beautiful would definitely buy again!
4,Absolutely beautiful!  I bought them for my sister who is getting married and she couldn't be happier!
4,En attente de la commande. C’est un scandale
4,"I have never received the ring, even after waiting three months. When I asked the seller, she only sent me a transport reference, inviting me to contact the services of transport, which was totally useless. She wasn’t helpful at all and I am very disappointed because I will never receive the ring and lost my money. 
I will never order again to this seller and recommend everyone to avoid this shop"
4,"Looks great, just like the picture.  Considering it had to come from overseas, it was shipped very promptly.  The only remaining question is how durable it is, but that will take time to see..."
4,"Lovely product, great communication.  Will buy from Rebekah again."
4,Me quedan muy bonitos.
4,Excellent customer service!
4,Beautiful jewelry and great service from Rebeka. Very responsive and very gracious. Package arrived very quickly! Thank you!
4,"Stunning earrings, I can't wait to wear them for my wedding....
Thank-you for creating such a beautiful piece of jewellery that I can cherish for a long time...."
4,"Beautiful earrings, lovely colour and great quality!"
4,"Exquisite earrings. I’ve purchased several items from this seller and I 
I’m thrilled with all of them. Enthusiastically recommend!"
4,"Great quality and fast shipping, thank you."
4,These earrings are beautiful. I will definitely purchase again from this shop!
4,"The item was okay, however, the picture is very misleading. The description matches the earings(the size of the stone), but the picture gives a different image of the item. For instance, in the sellers' image, the stone looks round, full, with vivid colors. In reality, this is not exactly the case. For one, the stones don't look the same. One stone is rounded and the other is not.  When I opened the box I was disappointed. Still, the earrings look good, but they didn't live up to my expectations.  The package was shipped on time. Everything else is okay, I guess."
4,Stunning jewelry and great service!
4,"It finally arrived and is very beautiful, however it is not the size ordered. It is three sizes too small. Disappointing."
4,Beautiful!!! Worth the wait for it to come from Israel!
4,Been a month and a half and still haven't received my earrings. When my wedding was 2 weeks ago....so needless to say I'll be requesting a refund
4,These earrings are beautiful. I can’t wait to wear them.
4,Most beautiful will be proud to wear my charm.
4,Arrived very timely.  A Christmas present for my granddaughter and I know she will be delighted and love the cameo!  Thank you!
4,Bought this for my friend and it is absolutely gorgeous and just as described!
4,I love these earrings! They will go perfectly with my wedding dress!
4,Great service and nice product.
4,Beautiful earring. It was a gift for my wife
4,Beautiful ring and smooth transaction
4,"Beautiful earrings and bracelet, as described. 
Will certainly purchase again and recommend to my friends."
4,"Beautiful item - smaller than advertised.
Beware customs fee ordering from the UK"
4,"This would be a 5 star review except the setting around the stone was more uneven/rough than expected. It was a gift, and the recipient said they loved the ring and would wear often!"
4,Fast delivery and as expected
4,"Pretty shade of red, make a statement"
4,super belle ceinture vraiment magnifique
4,Arrived safely in my mailbox.  It's more beautiful than I expected.  I love it.
4,"Lovely necklace, great detail. Would recommend this seller! Many Thanks"
4,"It's a little smaller than the image shows, so disappointed, it must be on a woman's hand to make it look larger? I had a similar men's ring that was twice the size for half the price. I'll wear it..."
4,Great looking pendant! Thank you
4,Beautiful cufflinks and arrived in plenty of time. Thank you
4,"Thank you, my beautiful earrings arrived  and I love them. I need to go look in your shop again xx Wonderful packaging and arrived very quickly. Thank you x"
4,Beautiful earrings. Make me feel like a star and great colours!
4,"Item arrived late but fortunately arrived safely and in perfect conditions! They're exactly as shown in the pictures, really lovely and original product (especially because it's customizable)"
4,Ace jewellery and UK made. Thanks!
4,"I love the colour of these earrings,  they are so unusual and I've had compliments on them already.  Many thanks"
4,"Fast shipping, fun & friendly creators, lovely earrings"
4,Bought as a gift and really happy with them. Thank you x
4,lovely bright colours thank you
4,good but a bit uncomfortably tight on the ears
4,"It was packaged nice and was delivered to me in a timely manner. The 925 Silver is shiny and very beautiful. However, I do think that these specific ones don't compliment my ear shape very well. They also would slide off my ear occasionally throughout my day when I would wear them. *5 stars for the fast shipping, reasonable prices, and secure packaging. Definitely looking forward to trying out some other styles of earrings and ear climbers from this shop in the future."
4,Looove them!!
4,Love these ear climbers they are my first pair definitely will be purchasing more! Great company got my item quickly and exactly what I wanted!
4,"I don't wear earrings a lot.  Due to my job requiring me to be on the phone almost 80% of my day, they are uncomfortable.  But these, are exactly what I needed!  I've gotten a lot of compliments on them!"

4,Love these ear climbers! Comfortable enough to sleep in as well.
4,"I got a notification that a shipping label had been created 20 minutes after I had placed the order.

These earrings feel sturdy and well-made while at the same time being delicate and minimalist. I've never worn ear-crawlers before so it took me a day or two to figure out what was comfortable. I was able to bend the back slightly to fit to my ear, and now it's been in place for a couple of weeks. I am very happy with this and it's exactly what I've been looking for."
4,Love these - thank you!
4,Super fast shipping and love the earrings even more than I thought I would!

Thank you for shipping, packaging and delivered on time 👍🏻😉!! They arrived safely after a long journey to the UNITED STATES 🇺🇸!!!  Thank you. Constance from Iowa ☮️ ✌️."
3,I love them. ❤️
3,"These are beautiful! They were a Christmas gift for myself. I do wish the wire fit a little tighter to my ear; because my earlobes are thin, they tend to drop instead of climb. But even then, I still love the way they look!"
3,"I LOVED these earrings as soon as I saw them, and was disappointed that they broke the first time I tried to wear them. I contacted Claudia and she immediately sent a replacement pair. I've been wearing them for over a month now, and I love them! They are so unique and beautiful. 
Claudia - Thank you so much for your prompt response, wonderful customer service, and lovely item. I look forward to shopping on your site in the future! :)"
3,It’s a bit blurry but as you can see in the picture these earrings fit perfectly! They’re beautiful and I already love them tons. No complaints- truly lovely pair of earrings.
3,Wow. These are even more stunning in person and look delicate and chic on my ears. The quality is very good and I will definitely shop here again!
3,"I love these earrings! I have received many compliments on them. They stay on very well and the opal stone is brilliantly colored. There was a slight delay in shipping but she contacted me and made sure everything would be okay, which is great! A wonderful purchase."
3,"Mir gefällt, dass die Ohrstecker eine völlig andere Form haben. Sie wurden pünktlich geliefert, alles gut.
Wie sie im Dauerbetrieb funktionieren, weiß ich n.n., da ich sie n.n.so lange trage. LG AnnA"
3,"I love these earrings so much! They arrived earlier than I expected, which was a plus because I wanted to wear them straight away! I've been wavering about purchasing them for a while and I'm so glad I finally did! I wear them in my second piercing while I wear my starbursts in my first and I feel so cosmic when I do! These are great and just as cute as expected."
3,In love w these earring and came to ny pretty quick. Ty !!!
3,"These are so cute! Exactly as pictured, and the seller is wonderful... she let me know there would be a shipping delay due to covid, and included an extra little gift because of that. Will absolutely order from this shop again :)"
3,"These are pretty. They are costume jewelry and have that look to them. They arrived quickly. The seller was great! I just expected the stones to look more real than they ended up looking. I think the phrase ""genuine vintage opal"" in the title was a bit misleading. The stones are noticeably glass. I like them, but I wouldn't have bought them had I realized. I don't think this was intentional on the sellers part."
3,Der Artikel wurde schnell versandt. Ein kleiner Mangel wurde sofort und unkompliziert  behoben. Danke und gerne wieder
3,Beautifully made and super easy to put on. Just love these. Thank you!
3,"coole Ohrklemmen (ich wußte nicht mal das es sowas gibt). Ich könnte mir vorstellen, das es als Ohrstecker noch besser hält? Bei meinen Ohren verrutschen sie gelegentlich. Stört mich aber nicht, ich habe mir noch mehr bestellt :-)"
3,"I received this and the other two items quickly (considering the trip from Germany to the US) and they all came beautifully packaged in individual boxes.  Each item is clearly well made and I’ve enjoyed mixing them into my daily jewelry routine.  Sharing the name of this artist with others, and looking forward to buying more in the future!"
3,"Die Ohrklemme gefällt mir sehr gut und die ""Mondphase"" wirkt durch den Glasopal echt. Tolle Qualität und Verarbeitung. 
Reibungsloser Ablauf, schneller Versand, vielen Dank!"
3,"Sie sind wunderschön und sehen genau aus wie auf den Bildern. 
Meine Beste wird sich sehr darüber freuen :D"
3,"Artikel kam rechtzeitig und gut verpackt an. Auch das Design und die Ausführung gefällt mir - die Ohrringe sind sehr schön gearbeitet. Allerdings sind mir die Opale etwas zu hoch und rund geraten, was man auf den Fotos nicht so gut gesehen hat. Trotzdem sind sie wunderschön. Vielen Dank."
3,Beautiful!! Absolutely love them! Great shop.
3,In love with these moonstone earrings
3,"Toller Kauf, sehen aus wie auf dem Foto und tragen sich total gut! Mehr als zufrieden 🌟"

3,Beautiful item
3,"I love these earrings! And they arrived without any issues, even though they were coming from another country. Since my ears are small they don’t stay clipped very well, so I end up wearing them hanging down which is cute too. Happy with the purchase."
3,"I love these earrings! They are exactly as pictured, and arrived quickly for being sent from Germany. They are beautifully made, and were well packaged with a complimentary silver polishing cloth. All in all, it was a fabulous transition, and I will definitely be a return customer."

3,"Very cute! Took awhile to get here, but that's to be expected when coming from across the pond.
I will need to adjust the backs with pliers in order to make them fit well. Could just be my ears though.
Would definitely recommend if you're looking for unique earrings."
3,"So beautiful! A tad smaller than what i hoped, and the stone isnt really a stone but they are still really nice and look very pretty. They arrived a few days late, but that was due to local mail."

3,"Beautiful earrings and very fast shipping. The metal on the back loops is a little thick, and I have a lot of trouble getting the loops into my ears, in the cartilage, and they won't sit quite straight in my ear. They're so lovely, though."
3,Swift shipping and very delicate and beautiful earrings! The only downside is that I have to adjust the position of the earrings a few times during the day but so far at least they've never fallen out.
3,Super cute! Just as pistured.

3,Very cute and got a cute bobby hair pin for my wait...
3,Item is exactly what is pictured & good quality.
3,"When these earrings came in, they had the wrong backs, which meant I couldn't wear them like they were made. I emailed Villa Sorgenrei just to inquire about it and not only did they send me a new pair with the correct backs (and did not have me send the wrong ones back), they also sent me another pair of earrings as a gift for dealing with the mistake! They had tremendous customer care, take so much pride in their products and work, and really do make beautiful jewelry! I will most definitely be ordering from them again soon!"
3,these earrings are a great way to make it look like you have multiple piercings. So pretty!

3,so very pretty and shiny
3,"These are really beautiful ear climbers and seem to be well made. They are slightly heavy due to the opal and tend to slip off the top of my ear, but that's a minor annoyance considering the quality."
3,"Thank you! Fast delivery, good seller :)"
3,very dainty and lovely.  arrived quickly
3,I like the look but they don't work well for me personally due to my thinner earlobes.
3,"Lovely earrings, a little bigger than expected but still very cute and recipient will love."
3,"These are my first pair of ""climber"" earrings, and they can be a bit uncomfortable to tighten against the back of my ear, but I love the earring design. Only request is whether the jeweler can find any creative ways to make the closure more comfortable in the back?"
3,Beautiful earrings and the shipment was fast!
3,These are just as described and beautiful.  I love them.
3,"Just beautiful!  Fast shipping, no hassles..."
3,Thank you so much!  Lovely earrings:)
3,"These are lovely earrings and I will enjoy wearing them.  There was a bit of a wait, as informed, but they are worth the wait."
3,Beautiful earrings. Fast shipping!!!
3,Beautiful earrings! My daughter loves them. Thank you!
3,"these earrings are beautiful,  but the design is awkward, with a long brace to hold them in the back.  they are uncomfortable and constantly slip down.   Seems that a regular post with the plastic disk around it, designed for heavier/larger earrings, would work better.  Also the opal is mounted on a thick silver disk, so from the front you can see it.  It would look better if the side of the opal were flush with the ear.   I also wonder if these have nickel in them since I have a slight reaction to the metal.  Hopefully the artist will take this as constructive feedback to improve the wearability."
3,Lovely earrings and quick delivery. Earrings larger than expected but they are still lovely...
3,Love these. Had to pinch them a little bit because one fell out of my ear. Now I just slide it slightly tightened over my ear.
5,A gift again I love them
5,Very cute. Reasonable price and arrived faster than expected.
5,"Fast delivery and interesting earrings, will make a great present! Thanks!"

5,"Subject:My only and last order from this company!

Date:

1 day ago8:02am EDT

Message:Good morning,
I wore this pair of earrings one time since I received them. The second time I attempted to wear them one of the earrings broke. I wasn't expecting a problem with these earrings so I discarded the packaging (especially since I sent a message that I thought I received a smaller size than what is represented on the website). How can I return these defective earrings? I have decided to shop elsewhere for my jewelry needs.
Tonya Goode"
5,"I‘m in love with these earrings😍They are so adorable. And I‘m really happy that they have 2 holes, so I can choose the length of the pendants and so they fit nicely on the earlobe."
5,"Gorgeous!! I was worried these beauties would not fit my ear shape very well because I don’t have very rounded earlobes... but I wanted to take the chance because I love the classy, minimalist look of them. They look GREAT! Take a chance, you prob love them too! Shipping was super fast, even though it was international. And the owner of the shop is so kind and gives great customer service! Gracias!!!"
5,Looove!
5,"I received the Silver ball ear jacket earrings.  They are very well made and sturdy.  The posts were fine, not too thick.  And something else noteworthy is that the back part where the balls hang is adjustable.  So if you're piercing hole is closer to the bottom of your ear lobe, you can adjust the back part so it doesn't hang too low.  Beautiful!!"
5,I love these earrings so much! So cute and dainty but still makes a statemetnt and the quality is great for the price! Will be buying more!
5,ABSOLUTELY LUV luv luv... these earrings ❤️🧡💙
5,"LOVE these earrings and I get so many compliments everywhere I go, beautiful work,  thank you so much!"
5,Me han encantado!! han llegado el pedido perfecto y con mucha rapidez! Repetiré!!
5,"I love these earrings so much that I repierced my ears to wear them! The quality is fantastic and they’re even cuter than I had hoped. Plus they are surprisingly comfortable.

Will be purchasing many more items from this shop!"
5,I love these earrings! I was a bit hesitant to buy them as I was worried they wouldn’t fit my ears (the jacket would be too large and hang lower than my ear lobe) but they fit perfectly. It has two holes on the jacket so you can adjust it to make sure they fit your ears well.
5,These have quickly become my very favorite earrings. I cannot believe how many people ask me about them and compliment how lovely and unusual they are. They shipped quickly and were beautifully packaged.
5,I love these and always get compliments and questions about where I got them
5,"Sooooo happy with these earrings. Very unique and suit me so well!
Thanks!"
5,The earrings are very pretty and true to the picture. They stay steady in your ears throught the whole day and the great thing is that they're adjustable and interchangeable
5,Love these earrings so much bought 2 pairs. Top quality. Perfect overseas shipping. My new favorite for earrings. Thanks so very much.
5,"Absolutely love these earrings! Dainty stylish, perfect for work or evening out."
5,These are really cool and unique! I love the earring jacket look! It is like having the impact of several piercings in one piece! Again with this style I could use an additional option for shortening the earrings tighter to my lobes. This is probably my own problem because my first piercings are so stretched out from little kids yanking on them in my youth! Very cool though!
5,Gracias he recibido mi orden y es exactamente lo que esperaba!!!
5,"I love the earrings, fast delivery and the customer service was wonderful. Very easy to talk to and so friendly!"
5,Gorgeous!!  Fit perfectly I love them!
5,It is just absolutely perfect!
5,Perfect ! As always ! In love with Lalia's jewelry.
5,"Hi Bylia,

Thank you for the beautiful earrings. I'm love them.

For years now, I have been waiting for earrings that use our ears as part of them. Our ears are beautiful. They are like jewels of the human body.

Your earrings do this exquisitely. 

They exceeded all my expectations. 

Genial!

All the best,
Clara"

I panicked and contacted the seller and she replied to me today that it would be delivered by US mail soon, that this often happened. I was very pleased that today in the afternoon the package did appear with my US mail. So if you are buying from the US don’t worry if the package doesn’t arrive on the day it says it will be delivered. The earrings are beautiful and I can’t wait to wear them! Thank you for the great customer service."

5,"These fit great and poke out from just under the ear. I like that it has two holes, for two potential hanging sizes. I've gotten many compliments wearing them. 

I do wish they were a little more curved/circular because they look more like a line under my lobe from certain angles,  but that could just be that my ear lobe is smaller than most."

5,"Nice earrings, thay fit well.

I received the earrings very quickly with in a view workingdays.

The only thing is that te back of the earrings goes loose, whereby the risk of loosing the earring is a bit bigger."
5,I received my item damaged. I got a refund back on the item but not shipping. I don’t understand why I have to pay for a damaged item.
5,"These are super cute, fit nicely, are easy to use, and got lots of compliments! The packing was safe, and the shipping was very fast. When I had a question about the item, the store owner replied very promptly. Be advised that the two ""jacket"" sections are textured on the same side (not mirror-images of each other), so when you flip one to wear it, they are slightly different. Also, the earrings I received look more like gold cylinders (about 3mm high) rather than the dimpled, button-like ones in the photo. This was totally fine for me, and I am very happy with my purchase, but if you have questions about the set, just ask the seller! She's very friendly and quick to get back with you. Overall, I love this set and feel pretty wearing it. :)"
5,"These are so fun!! They are definitely big which means they don't pair easily with other large earrings, but if you're buying them to be the statement piece (which is what I did), then they are perfection! Definitely my current favorite earrings! And easy to use with a mask!"
5,"I love these earrings and had a great experience with the artist, Suzy. I already purchased these in silver and loved them so much I ordered in gold. When they arrived the back on one earring was a little loose and ended up falling off somewhere within just a couple hours. :( I reached out to Suzy and almost immediately she responded saying sorry for the inconvenience and she’d send me a new one. Very happy with the earrings and customer service!"
5,"Love these earrings, first style like this I have got and they look great. Plenty of compliments. Thank you also for quick delivery!"
5,Love these! First time trying this style and I’m addicted. These are simple and elegant.
5,Love these!!! Wear them for a statement stud and also plan to pair it with a pearl stud for my wedding. :) thank you so much

5,These are very cute! You have 3 earrings in one. You can wear the studs or add a flair with the petals!
5,"The earrings are beautiful and I have gotten compliments already. My only lament is that the pattern is not symmetrical and I didn't get mirrored earrings they are the same ""side"" so in order to wear them in a mirrored way, the finish on one is the backside. Not highly noticeable, but would've been 5 stars if it was."
5,beautiful work! my mother loved the earrings and thought they were so unique!
5,"Love these! Have received a lot of compliments on the unique design. The post and circle appears to be a slightly different email material than the petals, but not noticeable from anyone else's perspective."

5,"Very elegant, worn it 4 times already."
5,Very cute earrings! Thank you!
5,Such a cute design. But they don’t come as shown. You don’t get the simple circle post earring. What does come left my ear green. Low quality 🤨bummed!
5,"Cute earrings, although I was charged shipping upon delivery as well as shipping when I paid for the item."
5,Not what I was expecting and it’s a 3 piece earring. However not all parts stay well on the bar.
5,"Earrings were cute, however when I received them the USPS man came to my doorstep and charged me additionally (from what I had already been charged when I paid for them) because the sender did not pay enough for the postage. I was very upset so I will not be ordering from this shop in the future. From the looks of the other reviews it seems like I’m not the first to have a problem with this shop."
5,Deceitful. heavy overcharge on shipping-upon receiving standard no. 10 envelope and 49 cents stamp contacted shop no refund/ no answer/no explanation.
5,"Earrings are absolutely beautiful and Inali was so incredibly sweet and accommodating when the US postal serviced seemed to misplace my package. She runs a fantastic shop and I highly recommend supporting her work. Thanks again, Inali! xx much love."

5,These earrings are beauty and arrived in great condition.
5,Beautiful but the second pair I’ve had to buy because the backs fall off very easily and they keep getting lost
5,Great item and transaction.  Thanks!
5,"Beautiful piece of jewelry, shipped quickly! And the seller customized the size for me. Definitely recommend!!"
5,"These are literally so beautiful. I don't spend very much money on jewelry in general because I tend to lose it, but these just felt so special. They look great and feel great. I can't say enough good things."
5,"I was worried that these would look too crazy to wear to the office, but they are the perfect mix of modern and work-appropriate."
5,I love this set.  It is very small but exactly what I wanted.  Thanks!!
5,"Holy moly these are cute! Very dainty and different, exactly what I wanted. Seriously quick shipping too. I'll definitely be a return shopper."

5,"Gorgeous, and great quality. I love them!"
5,Absolutely love these earrings!! They're exactly what I was looking for. They're beautiful and super comfy!
5,I love my new earrings!
5,"These earrings are awesome. I have wanted a pair of ear jackets since I saw a girl wearing them on an airplane a year ago. And, major bonus - I am not allergic to them! I have an unknown metal allergy that random earrings will provoke, but nothing from these, so happy. Will definitely order again!"
5,"Update: The shop reached out to me and offered to change the ear jackets with a custom pair that works for me. They are super cute and I am thrilled with the customer service. I now have several pairs of earrings from this shop; they are all of excellent quality and work well even for my sensitive ears.

These are super cute but unfortunately, the sunburst spokes on the jacket portion are too short to be seen behind my earlobes. It ends up looking more like you can see the back of an earring that you shouldn't than the style. They do seem to be well made and would be cute if the sizing worked better for me. I haven't decided yet if I will try to give them to a friend for whom they might work better or just wear the bar studs alone, which would be fine."
5,"Super fast shipping, wonderful earrings. I love that they come with both the stud and the ear jacket as a set. They're very unique and high-quality, I highly recommend them."
5,I think these earrings are so cool! They arrived at my house on time also! I will be buying more from this shop.
5,"These earrings were just what I was looking for and they didn’t bother my sensitive skin! Super cute. Also, I decided I didn’t like the matte finish and the shops owner had no issue with replacing these with the shiny finish as long as I paid for shipping which was fantastic!"
5,Love my earrings!! I got them on time and they came in a cute little box!!
5,great design & quick shipping! everyone compliments the earrings when I wear them :-)
5,I love the quality and design of these earrings but they were described as sparkly and they aren't. I was hoping to be able to use them formally but they would be fancier in shiny!
5,Super cute! I can't wait to order more!
5,"This was a present for my daughter’s friend. It’s beautifully made, simple, and unique and made a special Sweet 16 present. Thank you!"
5,These are beautiful Catie!  I love them. :-)

5,Perfect item! Shipping was fast. They are even prettier in person!
5,"I've already received countless compliments on these beautiful earrings! I love the size and unique style, with the added benefit of no ear irritation thanks to the sterling silver. I couldn't recommend more!"
5,I love these! Unique and eye catching. Cheesy rubber backings are lame but earrings are super cool.
5,"These are made very well, not cheap looking at all either. These are really tiny but still make a statement. Shipping was so fast too."
5,"I'm MF obsessed with these earrings. They are so comfortable that I actually don't take them out. I sleep in them, work out in them etc. #alwaystrendy"
5,"Love, love, love these ear jackets. Got a ton of compliments on how different and cool they were the first day I wore them! Only problem I have is that my ear lobe was torn when I was younger and the bar tends to slip through it from time to time. Not the earrings fault just something to be aware of if your ears have larger holes too."
5,Loved theses so much after I got myself a pair that I had to get a friend a pair too!

When I push the backing tighter the v gets lost in my earlobe fat lol... not a complaint about the product per se, just that the design doesn’t work for me."
5,c est pour offrir donc je saurais qu a noel si ça plait
5,Really lovely earrings thank you
5,Even prettier in person and arrived super fast. Liked them so much that I bought another pair of earrings in a different color

5,"It is shine and beautiful, the gift box well-made with good quality!  I have a long hair it looks cool with... My husband loves this earring. It looks natural and cute."
5,These earrings are precious! I love that they are small enough to be appropriate for an 11 yr old but still have enough detail to get noticed. The receiver and I both love the 3D effect and finish of the silver. Also I ordered them later than I should’ve and didn’t even consider they might arrive on time. But they shipped very quickly and they were here in time for the birthday girl’s party.
5,Shipping took FOREVER but not at all the sellers fault! Earrings are adorable and well made. My daughter put them on right away. She has multiple ear piercings and used the second holes for these. They look cute! Thank you!!!
5,"I really love these, they are super subtle even though they're faceted. High quality materials that keep my ears from swelling up when I wear them. Thanks!"
5,I love these so much. So glad I grabbed them. They're going to be my new go-to earrings for everyday. Thank you.
5,Beautiful earrings. The only reason that it didn't get 5 stars is that it didn't include a back. It included a small rubber stopper. Love the earrings and will add my own SS back
5,The earrings are lovely. I’m allergic to nickel so happy to find some silver earrings with hypoallergenic posts. They shipped very quickly too.
5,I bought these beautiful butterfly earrings for one of my granddaughters.  They were absolutely perfect.  They arrived quickly and were boxed perfectly for a Christmas present.
5,So pretty and exactly as pictured! Very satisfied and will be purchasing from this shop again! I received the earrings later than expected but the buyer put a bonus set of earrings for the delay of shipping! Absolutely love the bonus earrings! I also loved the packaging!
5,"I'm in love with these earrings. They're exactly what I was looking for. They are extremely comfortable - in fact I haven't taken them off since I got them! I don't even know they're there. I love hoop earrings, but my long hair gets tangled in them. These dangles with star climbers are the perfect antidote!"
5,Absolutely beautiful. My daughter loved them!  Thanks for getting them here well in advance of the holiday!
5,I am in love with these earrings. The customer service is superb!
5,"These earrings are simply stunning and I bought six pairs for gifts with one of those being for me.  The shipping took a long time, so that's the only reason that I didn't award FIVE STARS.  However, these ran on special on Black Friday, so I'm sure that Sharon was inundated with orders.  I'm also taking into account that the online sales volume was huge this season, so the mailing was delayed as well.  She was a great communicator and her designs are really special.  I'll be ordering from her again."
5,So pretty! These earring are so cute and just the perfect size. Loved them!
5,LOVE IT! Especially the fast shipping
5,Adorable! I liked them even more in person.

5,"Oh sooooo pretty! Dainty and lightweight but full of character. The colors and each piece are gorgeous. Perfect for those who want a little extra for their jewelry without compromising on weight, feeling over the top, or dealing with skin allergies. (I can only wear hypoallergenic jewelry and have worn this for a few hours so far without bother.)"
5,Very disappointed with the way the 3 pairs of earrings where shipped.  All three pairs on one card!  Now I have to look for boxes to wrap each one individually.  The stones are nice.

Deb Lanigan ,,          5stars...easily"
5,"Laura is easily the friendliest and efficient seller. Upon receiving the earrings, I was really fascinated with the intricate designs of the earrings. They are made out of sturdy and solid sterling silver. I also got compliments from my colleagues when I wore them to work! This is really a very special and interesting design, though it was my first time having to wear ear jackets and wasn't too comfortable with it, with that design on my ears, I wouldn't mind at all.

Love this pair of earrings and definitely coming back for more :) Thanks Laura!"
5,"I absolutely LOVE MY EARRINGS!!!!  Thank you thank you 
thank you. Beautiful work and such a unique and nice presentation upon delivery.  It was pretty fast delivery too...considering where it came from. 
Thank you and I will be back Dianne"
5,Quality! It's so well done. Pretty! Delivered well within time. Love the wood on which it was pierced into as well. Great job Laura!
5,Here they are at the back. They actually look really good on the front also. Really amazing thanks.
5,"I am so delighted with these beautiful ear jackets! Love the delicate details and craftsmanship. The slice of wood that the earrings came packaged in was a creative, rustic touch. Already eyeing additional stud earrings to mix and match with the jackets - thank you!!"
5,The earrings were exactly as pictured and excellent quality.  They were beautifully and creatively packaged.  I was amazed how quickly they arrived from overseas.
5,Love these little earrings! Have had many compliments on them.  Took a little while to get here from Lithuania but worth it!
5,Absolutely stunning earrings!
5,Beautiful!
5,Love everything I ordered...so cute!  Looking forward to wearing it all!!!
5,You won't regret buying these earring jackets... I love them. They are small but if you have short hair they are perfect!  I will be back for more!
5,"LOVE THESE SO MUCH! They're just a tad heavy so I can't wear them for long periods of time, but still so beautiful."
5,"Oh so lovely, delicate & petite"
5,I would most defiantly buy from this seller and jeweler. Well made and great packaging. wonderful quality.
5,quality and workmanship are superb. I have now bought 4 items from this artist and will definitely go back.
5,The earrings are  beautiful and fun to wear !!!
5,Très joli. Merci. Vendeuse sérieuse.
5,The earrings are lovely! Thank you so much!
5,good service and love the earrings.... keep up the good work.
5,These are cute and item arrived quickly.
5,These are exactly as described.  Metal is very high quality - they don't cause irritation in my ears like some other sterling silver earrings.  Love them.  Not 'blingy' like some others.  Have become my favorite earrings.
5,These are really beautiful earrings. Love wearing them with different fronts.
5,My girlfriend loves these - thank you!
5,Very pretty ear ring.  My only complaint is that it is quite delicate and smaller than expected.  I have long thick hair and need a bolder ear ring.
5,Item BETTER than described. Fast shipping. Thank you!
5,Love these! Thank you for the upgrade to a better material! I will probably be a repeat customer in the near future :)
5,"The x is much smaller than the picture suggests. It’s maybe the size of a pencil eraser. It’s kind of hard to see. Maybe these models just have tiny faces and ears, but i was expecting the earrings to be larger."
5,"Updated -
Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani!

Original Post July 30
""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures.  In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring.  However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them."""
5,"Leider habe ich einen Ohrkletterer gleich beim ersten Mal tragen verloren; hat schlicht nicht gut gehalten. Schade, denn ich finde sie sehr schön - den zweiten trage ich jetzt solo, aber nur unter größter Vorsicht...denn auch ihn hatte ich bereits verloren aber wiedergefunden. Und nachdem ich das bisher Geschriebene gepostet hatte,hat mich Shani kontaktiert u sofort angeboten mir nochmals Ohrkletterer zukommen zu lassen. Das ist unglaublich nett! und es liegt an meinen Ohren nicht am coolen Ohrschmuck! danke..."
5,"Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice. I have to mention that, they get a lot of compliments not only from my friends, but even from strangers. Also they shipped quicker than I thought. 
Thank you so much!"
5,This is my second pair of earrings from AIRlab and I just love them—so many people have complimented on their unusualness.
5,Love them!
5,"i've bought multiple items from this shop over time and i love them all! will continue to be a repeat buyer. Great shipping, great quality, delicate yet durable. very happy to recommend."
5,"Really beautyful, l love them!"
5,"I love these so much! My ears a pretty sensitive, and there is no irritation, and they are so cute!"
5,"These are so perfect! Shani was very flexible with me changing my mind and wanting two pairs at the same time and was kind enough to refund me the shipping for the second purchase so they could be sent together. Beautiful little pieces, and a pleasure to deal with Shani!"
5,Beautiful!
5,"wow~
I love your work.
This Minimalist Ear Climbers came to me after traveling a really long way. thank you~~~"
5,Good quality! Happy with it!
5,"my 2nd order from this shop, great quality, very cute and unique!"
5,One of my favorite earrings to wear! They are simple yet elegant - a really beautiful pair of earrings.
5,They are perfect ❤️ great to wear
5,"A really nice seller and a unique, quality product, I will be returning!! Thank you!"
5,"Sehr filigrane Ohrringe, könnten für meinen Geschmack etwas größer gestaltet sein- im Übrigen alles ok."
5,"Those earrings are wonderfull! Unfortunatly, I guess my ears are too thins: I lose them all the time. I tryed to ""flatten"" them myself, but it's worst! Anyway, I love them!"
5,Beautiful piece of jewelry...I love it!
5,"So simple! The others I've seen around are bigger, I prefer the subtleness of these. They don't irritate my sensitive ears either. This is my second pair. I lost my first pair on the first time I took them out after 3 months straight of wearing."
5,Perfect and lovely thank you!!!
5,"Vackra smycken, tack och många hälsningar från Tyskland! <3"

5,"Beautiful, comfy, simple and elegant. Exactly what I was looking for :)"
5,Love the ear climber! Arrived in a timely manner. I would purchase from this seller again. Thank you!

5,My ears are a bit funny but they fit pretty good
5,Good work and timings. Thank you
5,Beautiful minimalist earrings. I'm a returning customer and I guess that says everything.
5,I like them very much!  I already wear them!
5,Unfortunately it looks like u have a grin on your earlobe. Not at all lika u would think a climber earing.
5,"I bought multiple pairs of ear climbers because I wasn't sure what I wanted. Others from different shops were uncomfortable, pinched my ears, fell off, or just didn't sit right. These are PERFECT and I couldn't be happier!"
5,"I got the gold and gold, and I love it! It’s very lightweight and comfortable, and I forget I have it in. 10/10 recommend."
5,These earrings are amazing! The beadwork stays in place - no risk of losing a bead from the set. Love them!! And the shop owner is super responsive if you have any questions.
5,"Beautiful! They’re exactly what I wanted, I’m so happy with them. Thank you!"
5,Seller was very helpful! The ear climbers are beautiful!! :)
5,"Beautiful piece. The opposite ear piece was mistakenly sent, and Keren promptly responded and sent me another one immediately (and was flexible in changing the color!). Thanks!"
5,"Alles super! Vielen Dank! Bin sehr zufrieden, der Schmuck sieht sehr schön aus!"
5,These are super pretty but they irritate my ears and they always slide out and I loose them all the time. Very pretty though.
5,"Beautiful!! :-)  well hand crafted. My daughter Loved it. Would definitely purchase from this site again.
Thank You"
5,"Beautifully made, fast shipping, thank you!!"
5,"They are cute, I struggle to get them to stay on my ear. I'll have to try putting a stopper near my piercing and see if it helps."
5,Very beautiful. Just not very sturdy and bent when I received them.
5,Love ❤️
5,"My ear climbers are elegant and a bit sassy. I get lots of compliments. The short climbers are a perfect size for my small ears and are very comfortable to wear. I love them!
The international delivery and correspondence was very quick. I'm already trying to work out my next Glamrocks Designs purchase - thank you!"
5,"Perfect! The mini is also an awesome size for those of us with small, thin earlobes. Totally love it."
5,"These are super cute - they were a tiny bit wider than I anticipated but not significantly. Since these were my first pair of ear crawlers it took me a few times to get the hang of putting them in, but I've gotten better at it each time. I've gotten so many compliments on these.. wish I had bought more :)"
5,Such a simple style but also very unique. I get so many compliments on these. Love them! Thank you!
5,"I love them! Simple and unique, which is exactly what I wanted. Very fast shipping- just perfect!"
5,I love them! They look small in the package but once on they are the perfect size! I love the bobby-pin style. Very cool
5,this is my 2nd or 3rd replacement for a lost side. i just love them so!
5,"These earrings are beautiful, comfortable and just as pictured! There was a little confusion with the tracking # not updating, but Kristen was awesome in helping out with it. Received them on time as well :)"
5,"I wanted a delicate, minimalist, unique pair of earrings to wear on my wedding day. These are perfect! I can't wait to wear them :)"
5,Love them!
5,My new favorite earrings. These ear climbers are well made and COMFORTABLE - I love that I can sleep in them without a pokey earring back stabbing my head! They arrived quickly. Would definitely buy more!
5,"Super cool earrings; love the look.  They do get snagged occasionally on the back, but I wear them anyway and just check that they're still there every once in a while.  They're just that cute.  :)"
5,"Love these earrings! I have received many compliments on them. They are easy to wear and they stay in place, no sliding around or twisting. Super cute!"
5,Love these earings so much I keep buying them as a gift for my sisters and friends birthdays. These are the earings I wear everyday and I always get complements and asked where I got them!  LOVE!!

5,"Beautifully made! I've had lots of compliments, and they are very comfy to wear."
5,"Envoi rapide, soigné! Je suis ravie de porter ces boucles d'oreille le jour de mon mariage !"

5,"Really cute piece, I got the silver climber and I love it, also it came in the mail fast"

5,These are perfect! Dainty (and very durable so far) they go with everything and are fun and different.
5,"Understated and fabulous, just what I wanted."
5,"I love these earrings. I lost one of them, and loved that I could order just one as a replacement. wonderful work."

5,I love these!! I got them to replace some my husband had purchased for me from another site that just didn't fit my small ears. But these are the  perfect size and great quality.

5,thank you!! xoxo
5,I love these! So fun and modern.
5,"The post on the earring gets bent and misshapen quickly -- it's ok, the earring still works, but something to keep in mind. I also find these earrings irritate my ears...perhaps something in the metal amalgam. Otherwise, they have a great, simple look."
5,Beautiful earrings! I've gotten lots of compliments and I just recently got them!
5,comfortable and beautiful earrings. Love them!
5,"I love these earrings, very pretty, good quality, comfortable. Have gotten several compliments on them already."
5,They were pretty
5,Loved both the silver and the gold
5,Arrived beautifully wrapped. Good quality and they look great! Thanks!
5,"I love these earrings!  They are very well made. Contrary to some other reviews, you do not need to bend the earring in order to insert it into your ear; you just need to twist it around to get into place."
5,"Nice earrings. Didn't fit my ear well. Gave them to my gf. Fit hers fine. (I'm also a girl, btw)"
5,Love these! So cute.
5,Great quality and fast shipping!!
5,Love my earrings! Sure cute and shipped really fast!
5,"They look exactly like the pictures, and the rose gold color is really nice! The only thing I would have liked to know is that you have to bend the back of the earring to get it on. It would have been better if it was on a hinge so that the metal doesn't wear out over time. Love the look regardless!"
5,"Beautiful, came just as expected."
5,Fit nice and shipped quickly!
5,Item is as pictured and shipping was fast! Love it!
5,"Really cute! Only had them for a day, but I know I can wear them with anything! :)"
5,Simple elegant design. Have received many compliments. :)
5,"Absolutely loved them. Found them to be too loose and moved easily on my ears when I put them in yesterday. So I moved them to angle higher on my ear and pinched them to try to make tighter. Went to grocery store, got back in the car, looked in mirror... one missing😢"
5,Love these earrings! Very simple way to feel more put together.
5,Beautiful simple and elegant earrings just what I was after!
5,My new favorite earrings! Thank you!
5,Beautiful earrings - already getting compliments!
5,Beautiful and definitely one of a kind.
5,Gorgeous earrings! Very fast shipping!!

5,Love these earrings! Wear them almost everyday!
5,"love these, wear them everyday... barely know they are in my ears!"
5,Second time I order this item. Love it!
5,Beautiful earrings and high quality.
5,"Beautiful and fast shipping, thank you! Will buy again :-)"
5,This item is beautiful. I bought it partially because it looked sturdy as if it would be comfortable enough to sleep in but secure enough to stay in. After three days it fell out and is nowhere to be found. I was very excited about the idea of this item and would like to order another but I'm too afraid of it falling out again.

5,"I LOVE these ear jackets!  As soon as they arrived, I switched out what I was wearing for these, and I've barely taken them off since!  They are very well made, and I just love the look.  I measured my ears to ensure these would fit (well, I had a helper).  They sometimes fit a little longer than pictured, but if I push the bottom against my ear, they look as pictured.  Either way is great - don't hesitate!  Virginia, thanks for making these for me!"
5,"I absolutely love Virginia's designs - they are simple, elegant, striking, and unique all at once. I purchased several pairs of earrings because I just couldn't pick a favorite. I cannot wear any of them without getting compliments. I'm sure I'll treat myself with more her beautiful pieces in the future and will recommend this shop to anyone who asks in the meantime. Thanks so much!"
5,Fab!
5,"I have always hated jacket earrings...until I saw these!!!  So cute, such simple design, clever, and modern.  I love them!!"
5,"Beautiful handmade earrings. My earlobes are kind of small so the ball spheres hang down a little lower than shown in the picture, but they are really cool anyway. The seller kept in touch with me about shipping when the wait was a little longer than expected. Thanks!"

5,"Un peu déçue par le saphir que j'imaginais plus lumineux. Pas bien grave, le bracelet fait qd même son petit effet mais c'est la pierre par elle-même que je trouvais intéressante. Cela ne m'empêchera pas de faire d'autres achats ici."
5,"Exactly as described and pictured. The seller was prompt to respond to my questions, make the bracelet, and ship my order. I am very happy with the quality of the materials and craftsmanship. I love this bracelet that I had made to celebrate my son's birth."

5,Absolutely beautiful! This is my current favorite from the 4 I purchased! Love it so much. I have gotten many compliments♡
5,"To say I loved this nose ring is an understatement.. Definitely worth the wait of shipping. I wore this nose ring everyday and never felt irritation. Plus it’s so aesthetically pleasing to look at. It also came in a cute, hand made lil box!.. I unfortunately lost mine recently when cleaning it and plan on buying a new one ASAP!"
5,"I took a jump because it looked beautiful online and ordered the blue opal. I was NOT disappointed! I haven't taken it off since! Stays put, perfect fit, and beautiful! Will be ordering again!"
5,"Best piercings I've ever worn. I have a sickness causing my hands being unable to keep a firm grip of any capacity. And these piercings were super easy even for me to get in place, and they stay in place and they do not shed anything. Very good quality. 👍 Love the tiny wooden box they came in and they arrived very early as well."
5,"I love it! But I will warn you, it is smaller in person! I don't know if my eyes deceived me but I giggled when it arrived and was tiny! It looks really cute in my ear though, I'm super satisfied. Will 100% be purchasing again!"
5,Lovely medusa jewelry that came in a gorgeous little box. I accidentally pulled it out when I stupidly opened a can of pop with my teeth but it gave me a prompt excuse to order two more. It fits lovely and the plastic bar feels so much better than a metal one hitting my teeth. Will buy from here again. Thank you!
5,This nose ring is my favorite by far. It looks gorgeous on and is very comfortable. The packaging was beautiful as well. I love the little wooden box included. I will use this seller again!
5,Beautiful septum ring! It’s a little snug but that’s my fault for order the wrong size. I don’t even care though! I’m going to wear it anyway.❤️
5,"Only thing I wish I had considered is how bright the silver would be. It’s a darker tone and doesn’t match my other earrings. A small issue because otherwise the earring is fantastic! Worth the wait! (Shipping took a long time, but it is international during a pandemic...)"
5,"Another stunning septum p9. In total I have 7 septum 9ô8 from here - I Love them. Beautifully sturdy, easy to put in, looks gorgeous and came beautifully packaged. Such an amazing seller. Thank you 💕"

Even tho I made a mistake when ordering, the owners actually sent me the correct size with my next order. I will continue to buy from Titanium Fashion."
5,"I love this nose ring. It's really good quality and the design is so beautiful! If you're looking for something beautiful and unusual, this shop will have it! ♥️"

5,"Super cute septum ring, it's stunning and something you can wear everyday. My new fave."
5,"I love the jewelry and they were very accommodating as I asked them to make a 6mm. I bought 2 however 1 had 1 of the gems fall off, I contacted them and they made me a new one. The shipping does take 2-3 weeks but it wasn’t a big deal for me. I love them and they look great 😊"
5,Ordered 4 different products.  All are beautiful and came in an adorable wooden box
5,"Excellent quality, well made, absolutely beautiful, and exactly what I’ve been looking for!  Was so happy with my purchase, I immediately ordered more pieces!  Highly recommended. 😊"

5,Absolutely love these septum rings! so unique and detailed. Will be buying more from this shop <3
5,"The septum is very nice. I bought them as a gift and both of them said it was great. The gauge and size was perfect! I loved the box it came in,although I only was able to give the box to one of the girls. Thank you!"
5,I purchased 4 septum rings and they’re all great. Very lightweight so I’ve been wearing them every day. I’ll definitely order more!
5,Great quality and came in a super cute box.
5,I love the delicate style! Very unique
5,"Gorgeous, fit is perfect now I've picked the right gauge!! Quick despatch, lovely packaging (the little puzzle box case is lovely for storing jewellery without it getting lost. Will come back because the products are great, postage is great, and I'm a magpie 😂"
5,"I love my new jewelry! It's beautiful, and it's so comfortable. I have metal allergies, so finding affordable, nice jewelry that won't give me trouble can be difficult. I've been wearing this in my daith for several days and I've had zero irritation at all. Communication with the artist was quick and courteous, and I didn't have to wait as long as I expected for shipping. I cannot recommend this shop enough!"
5,"Best piercings I've ever worn. I have a sickness causing my hands being unable to keep a firm grip of any capacity. And these piercings were super easy even for me to get in place, and they stay in place and they do not shed anything. Very good quality. 👍"
5,This is the first curved bar I’ve found for my helix that doesn’t hurt to sleep on. I’m very excited.
5,"First time I get clickers for my daith piercing, they are very beautifully made and look exactly like the pictures. Since I never bought clickers before I also needed help from seller to choose the right size and I was well advised. Don’t hesitate to ask questions if you need too, nor to buy from the seller! Sending and delivery was quite quick compare to other Etsy shops. It was delivered in a cut wood box stamped with the initial of the brand (which I now use to keep my tongue piercings).
5 stars transaction and services."
5,Beautiful piece. I purchased 4 pieces from this store and have only tried two in my nose piercing. Absolutely love them so far. Will definitely buy from here again ♡

5,It was late due to the pandemic but the seller answered all my questions regarding shipping. Looks beautiful.
5,I love my nose rings!!! Thank you so much!! I'll be buying again! ❤️
5,"The ring took forever to arrive, but it’s quite pretty. Unfortunately the gold plating faded VERY quickly, so now it’s half silver. :/"
5,"Bijoux fin et subtil, je me suis juste trompée sur le diamètre j'ai pris 12, trop grand vu aussi le diamètre du "" fil "" ou gauge, et vu aussi l'emplacement de mon hélice...
Je recommenderai plus petit et un autre modèle que titanium fashion fait..."
5,The clicker almost locks in place and is very difficult to undo so you can change out the jewelry. It is slightly painful to remove because of this.
5,"This is the earring I wear on a day to day basis, its really comfortable and I've had quite a few compliments on it as well."
5,I was very very happy with this order at first. I have only been wearing this hoop for about one month and it had turned from gold to completely silver in color. It’s very well made and the perfect size and fit but I am disappointed that it is no longer gold. So my search continues.
5,Gorgeous dainty nose stud. Came a week earlier than estimated & beautifully packaged. Very pleased with it & will reccomend/purchase from again :)
5,I love the color so much!
5,"It was beautiful and good quality. I ordered the 7mm size, but it was actually only 5mm. It didn't work for me but was perfect for my daughter."
5,"Beautiful nose ring, but it took a while to arrive."
5,The most beautiful piercing jewelry ever. I’ll always be your customer. Thank you!

5,I LOVE IT THANK YOU! :)
5,"The size was a size of a 16 gauge, couldn't get it in the piercing wanted a 18 gauge expected the flower though to be bigger."
5,Thank you for those gorgerous pieces. I wear them daily. Very happy. (:

5,Very nice
5,Perfect I like it a lot and even my sensitive ears like it!
5,Beautiful and very carefully packaged.

5,Honestly shipping was fast and looks exactly like the photo !!
5,"Larger than I thought, but looks nice"
5,Took a lil while to arrive... but soooooo worth the wait!
5,"I’ve been looking for rings that I can take in and out easily for work. So a clasp has been desired. However, I only got to wear this about 5 times before the clasp broke. I tried to fix it but the hinge bar would not stay in. I guess that comes with the nature of something so small and delicate. I loved the design and the quality of the metal seemed fine."
5,Gorgeous and fits well.  Thanx
5,"I gave it as a gift to my older sister, and she loved it. It fit well, looked good, and even came in a cute little box."

5,"I put it in my rook piercing, it fits very well"
5,"perfect earrings, unusual,  thank you"
5,J’aime bien la grandeur et c’est solide mais le doré n’est pas rester !
5,I love it but the backing is confusing... The earring doesn't appear to have a long enough metal bit and the plastic backing is difficult to use and I've already bent it :( is there somewhere i could find a similar backing?

5,Thank you! My girlfriend loves them!
5,Absolutely stunning earrings! I can't wait to wear them for my wedding!
5,Adorable! They are perfect for my wedding.
5,"Pretty earrings, well made and sturdy. However they do need adjusting to ensure they stay in place. Possibly due to their weight."
5,Very pretty and well made.
5,Can’t wait to wear these for my wedding!!! They are absolutely beautiful

5,"Earrings were beautiful, better than the pictures!"
5,"A gift for my niece and she loved them, fit wonderfully :)"
5,"These earrings look exactly like they appear from the front, a nice and unique design. However the back closure is awkward and I find they often slip down so they do not stay on your ear properly. Additionally they are quite delicate so when you try and pinch the closure shut, the earring bends. Ultimately too awkward to wear."
5,The earrings are very beautiful
5,"Very pleased with these ear crawlers, they will make a perfect gift for my daughter."
5,They arrived earlier than expected. They are exactly as pictured
5,"I can’t get them to stay, they fall to the side."
5,"Really disappointed with this shop. I placed my order on 14th April and on the delivery description said that it would take up to 3 days to be shipped. I contacted the shop twice to query as my order never arrived. The email was only replied days later when finally the order was sent 15 days after my order was placed. Today, Still hasn’t arrived and it lost the purpose of the purchase as it was for my wedding and I have already left the country."

I have had no problems with ear discoloring or ear irrational in my pierced ears which I do on some that are not real gold.  Not a problem with this jewelry.

5,"I cannot express how supremely satisfied and thrilled I am with Anja’s professionalism, responsiveness, courtesy, and the product itself! 
The anklet is a beautiful piece of work with unparalleled attention to detail. I especially love the clasp. It takes some getting used to but is strong and reliable. It was very thoughtful of her to have made the bells removable because sometimes I wish to wear them and sometimes not. I especially love that the size is customizable— something not available with other sellers. 
The packaging was neat and a pleasure to unpack! Order date July 15 (afternoon), received July 30. 

Overall, no one and no other product could possibly compete! I will certainly be ordering more. 

Will post a photo later. 

Thank you so much! :)"

5,"Der Ring ist wunderschön. Ich habe ihn jetzt schon knapp zwei Wochen jeden Tag getragen. Die Größe lässt sich wunderbar nachjustieren, dass heißt, auch wenn die Finger mal dicker oder dünner sind, kann man den Ring immer bequem tragen. Anfangs dachte ich, der Ring sei zu groß, aber man konnte ihn leicht zusammenbiegen, so das er perfekt sitzt.
Der Ring kommt in einer wunderschönen kleinen Box. Er ist nachhaltig verpackt und dazu hat man eine schöne Aufbewahrung für den Ring. Ich liebe solche Details, wenn man sieht, mit wie viel Liebe da jemand Sachen verkauft.
Außerdem bekommt man noch ein kleines Heftchen, wo Pflegetipps stehen. 
Ich bin auf jeden Fall sehr happy, dass ich diesen Ring ausgewählt habe, und kann es jedem nur empfehlen!"

5,"Zuerst mal: Eine wahnsinnig schnelle Lieferung - sonntags bestellt und Dienstag geliefert. Das ist mal absolute Spitzenklasse - wie überhaupt der ganze Kontakt; schnell, kompetent, richtig individuell und einfach wunderbar herzlich.

Und der Zehenring?
Sitzt perfekt, sieht klasse aus und fühlt sich super an - nach kurzer Zeit merkt man ihn gar nicht mehr - ein toller Hingucker gerade jetzt in der kühleren Zeit, wo Füße ohne Schuhe draußen ohnehin schon mehr auffallen.
Auch super: der Lieferung sind ein Reinigungstuch sowie eine ausführliche Pflegeanleitung beigelegt.

Das war jetzt mein zweiter Zehenring von LYD und da hatte sie einen neuen Pflegetipp eingepackt, weil die allgemeine Anleitung hier ja schon vorliegt.

Also langer Text, kurzer Sinn: Super Schmuck, super Händler, super Service - 10 Sterne! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

le médaillon est très mais très très petit, et tout aussi léger, on ne penserais pas qu'il soit question d'argent, et pourtant ca l'est. 90.80 € pour un médaillon de la taille d'une pièce de 20 cent, c'est cher payé. je ne peut de ce fait recommander ce vendeur a cause de cela."

The stones and metal are of the best quality.

5,"Beautiful and well crafted, perfect gift!"
5,Lovely earrings and prompt delivery. Thank you!
5,Lovely! Planning to wear at my wedding.
5,BEAUTIFUL earrings! I love these earrings so much! I wore them in my wedding and received so many compliments.  The sparkles were gorgeous. I technically didn't wear them as intended with the climbing style because I realized that personally I have pretty small ears and when I put them on as so the earrings kind of flared out. So I switched sides with the earrings and allowed them to hang down. They were beyond expectations and SO beautiful. I would highly recommend these earrings and shop to anyone looking for the perfect amount of sparkle and beauty!
5,"I absolutely love this earrings!!! The crystals are sparkling so beautifuly and they're really stylish. They're exactly as I wanted them to be, can't wait to wear them on my wedding day! It's a really special final touch on my outfit for That Day... THANK YOU A LOT!! <3 <3 <3"

5,Love love love my earrings!!! Thank you so much! Fast shipping. Great customer service and quick response to my questions asked. Would definitely recommend and will purchase again from this seller in the future! Very beautiful jewelry!!! Thank you Ilona Rubin!
5,The earings are super pretty and very sturdy it came in time and they look expensive.  My advice is the scroll the little thing on the top so it will adjust to your ear. It came a little tight after loosing up the thing they fit perfectly. Thank you!
5,"Absolutely stunning earings!!! My only complaint: while the clamp style backing on the top of the earing is great for keeping it in place, it is slightly uncomfortable. That said, I'm very happy with this purchase and would definitely buy from this seller again."
5,The earrings are amazing!! I love them. Great quality. I wanted them in silver rather than gold and they were made exactly as I requested.
5,"These are absolutely perfect for my wedding day!  I will have two looks.  I will use them as crawlers with my hair in an updo and I will switch them to be vertical for my half-updo.  I can't wait!  They are gorgeous, thank you!"
5,"These earrings are very pretty. I like how strongly the back holds onto the earring. I almost thought I couldn't get it off, but it'll be great to hold these babies up for my wedding. Very nice."
5,The earrings are really lovely! Looks exactly like on the pic even more beautifully!. I am really happy that I chose them. Thank you ! :)

5,Beautiful...exactly what the bride wanted to wear on her wedding day
5,Love the earrings. They are absolutely beautiful and classy. Can't wait to wear them at my wedding.
5,Beautiful earrings - the upper cuff on one was angled differently than the other so it was harder to keep it on my ear. Otherwise I received many compliments on the earrings and loved how they looked.
5,Beautiful earrings. Small but with a big statement.
5,Beautiful piece of jewellery but top end isn't flush to my ear - might be because my ears are quite small but they're not any smaller than the model's ears. I'll need to apply facial glue to have them flush to my ears.
5,Arrived as described😊  Packaged Lovely🥰.  Thank You😁

5,I can’t tell you how excited I was to receive the Florida orange perfume bottle.  I have been looking for one for years.  Thank you for the care you took in packaging the bottle arrived in perfect condition.   As a child in the 50s my neighbor and I would get our allowance and go to the 5&dime. We were always lured by the Florida orange perfume in its unique container.  Maybe a long walk down memory lane but I couldn’t be more thrilled. Our little Florida town hasn’t changed much except you can no longer find a 5&dime or an orange shaped perfume bottle. Thank you so much for everything!! Sincerely Judy

5,"Received my earrings very quickly, as promised. I love them."
5,"Very happy,  earrings are beautiful, wish I had ordered a pair for myself. Good communication and shipping."
5,I LOVE THEM.They are great
5,Very happy with my earrings. Looks exactly like picture and postage was super quick!
5,Love these earrings!! They are beautiful and just like the picture!
5,I am very happy with the purchase.
5,They are beautiful. Sit perfectly against the ear. Super quick delivery. Very happy with purchase.
5,"Lovely earrings, but more of a gold than a rose gold."
5,"Not quite what I thought, but still very happy with them. Communication with seller is great also, thank you very much!"
5,The colour for the rose gold is really different to the picture and they also definitely look longer on the ear than in the photo. Seller said it was okay to return but then had a go at me for saying the two products looks different and didn’t feel it was fair I cop the shipping costs as it cost me as much as the earrings. Probably wouldn’t shop here again.
5,Some of the wire is a tiny bit rusty but overall very happy with my purchase!
5,"Extremely happy with the colour, quality and fit! Has a really nice weight to it and is obviously not made with a cheap, crappy material. Originally got the yellow gold necklace but it wasn't my colour, so I returned it and got the rose gold and it was perfect. Will definitely purchase another item in the future!"
5,"I love it , it’s so pretty and fits perfectly. I have a slim neck and I like that it rests mid way."
5,Super fast shipping. Love these earrings
5,Love it!  Great item. Speedy delivery perfect!
5,They arrived in a timely fashion in a nice little bag.  The earrings themselves are smaller than pictured - I wanted them to go higher up the ear but am pleased that they are pretty enough to wear.
5,I’m very very pleased with my purchase & very happy with the customer service Thank you 😊 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
5,"As far as gold collars go, this is one of the best.  Very well made, sturdy and looks amazing with a charm on it."
5,Love these earrings; haven't stopped wearing them!
5,Absolutely beautiful and well made! Would definitely recommend!
5,Great color and good workmanship. They are different and fun.
5,Love this shop! My go to for chokers in various color finishes as well as  matte or glossy choices.  Great communication too!
5,"Sits beautifully on the neck.. very elegant and Albert, the owner of this store was polite and very easy to do business with.. business with ease is always a happy experience, recommend having a look..juluex"
5,Many thanks. Beautiful earrings .
5,"I love gold collar necklaces and this is exceptional, it’s perfect"
5,Quick delivery. Product as expected.
5,"The choker us exactly like I wanted, and fits perfect. It arrived in the time expected in excellent shape. The merchant, Albert, of Dazel Creations was very easy to work with. He responded quickly to my questions."
5,The earrings are just as pictured and very nice. They can be worn with so many things.
5,Quick delivery and item was as described.
5,"I really like it, very nice quality of work but it was too short for my neck. I have an average size neck, not at all fat but it didn't  go all the way around. When I contacted Albert, he would send an extender."
5,Elles sont magnifiques et s’adaptent à tous les styles. Mon petit astuce: j’entrecroise les extrémités en pressant un peu le haut de la boucle pour ne par risquer de la perdre. Je les adore 😍
5,Love the simplicity and material of this choker!
5,So beautiful ??
5,"Took a little longer then i expected but its the holiday season and was coming from another country. Not being able to track it was probably the only complaint I have.

It is perfectly described and beautiful, the girl who received it was ecstatic! Great job!"
5,A little  bit smaller than I expected but otherwise perfect.
5,"Item arrived the same day it was posted (though we're in the same city) and is exactly as described. Lovely earrings, will definitely be shopping with them again."
5,Fast turnaround and earrings were just as I expected.
5,The wire choker fits perfectly.
5,"Lots smaller than the picture made out. A little disappointed with the size, but shipped quickly and easy to deal with"
5,"I love it, as described on the photo.
Very happy"
5,This came as gold. Not rose gold
5,The gold flakes off after a white but still beautiful
5,Great quality and sturdy but looks lovely and elegant.  Very happy with the style!
5,It’s awesome! Thanks. Fast delivery too!

5,Item took a very long time to arrive so not advisable if required for a specific time or present. Supplier was very helpful during the wait and did offer a refund. The item was originally for myself an adult size 12 with a slim neck but is very neat fitting and although I could wear it i am going to keep for a present for my granddaughter. The item itself is very pretty and well made

5,When I saw these I just had to buy them! They are so different and look so great on. They are not heavy either. Love them.
5,"Scheint nicht aus einem Metallguss zu sein. An dem Teil, das im Ohr sitzt platzt eine Beschichtung ab.

Ich habe echten unbeschichteten Silberschmuck und der ist biegsam. 

Das hätte ich bei diesem Produkt auch vorausgesetzt, da ja jede Ohr-Form anders ist und eine Anpassung benötigt.

Hübsch sind die Ohrringe, aber es hilft nichts, wenn man sie nicht an das Ohr anpassen kann, ohne dass sie brechen.

Man zahlt wohl für das Design nicht das Material."
5,"Superbes boucles offertes à ma sœur pour son Noël, elle est ravie. 😉"
5,Climber is shorter in length than on photo. So it sits rather awkwardly on the lobe.
5,Really like these!  Will wear a lot!  Thanks
5,What a beautiful set of earrings. I’m looking forward to jazzing up my next outfit out with them!
5,This is very nice. Thanks.
5,Amazing amazing amazing... would have paid 3 times this amount on a site like West Elm but the quality in this cactus series is even better! Love them all.

5,"Beautiful, exactly as described, and arrived on time. My mother and have always loved Asian culture but honestly, whose doesn’t lol? Architecture, furniture, martial arts, cuisine, clothes, philosophy, you name it. I figured this lamp would be a great gift and I was right! She loved it!"
5,So cute! This cactus brightens my desk at work and makes me happy every day!
5,"I have one of these that I bought from Target and I love it.  This was a comparable item, but a few dollars more than the one from Target (although I can’t find them at Target anymore).  This item was used as part of a trophy, in which an adorable mini “ugly Christmas sweater” was placed over it and given as an award.  The winner of the trophy proudly displays the trophy."

5,Love these earrings! They are the perfect size. Also shipping  was incredibly quick!
5,"Love this ear crawler and all my pieces from Vintage Acorn. Well crafted, friendly seller and was able to pick up at my convenience!"
5,Very cute! Has a little bend though so I would be careful if you're very active.
5,"Love love these! Casual enough for everyday wear, but flattering like dressy earrings. Really flattering."
5,My wife loved these. They’re easier to put on than other ear climbers and look great.
5,Super cute climbers and the packaging was lovely.
5,"My earring arrived very quickly, love the earring and the cute little box it came in.
Thank you"
5,"J'aime le look de la boucle d'oreille, toutefois elle bouge un peu puisque la tige derrière n'est pas comme celle des grimpeurs d'oreille traditionnels."
5,Very cute exactly what I was expecting.
5,I’m excited to gift this! Thank you!
5,Pretty. But they are a little flimsy and sometimes hard to put in and get out. They are very pretty though.
5,Beautiful piece and fast shipping! Thank you!
5,"The climbers look great, and seem high quality.

There were some issues with shipping, causing them to take more than 25 days to arrive from the time when I was notified that they were shipped. Not entirely the seller's fault, as the Canadian post went on strike for a while and probably delayed the shipping, but unfortunately they did not arrive in time for Christmas, as they were intended to be a gift."
5,"Great earring, does not always stay up (e.g. if caught in hair of scarf)."
5,I cant stop ordering these! I am blessed to have expensive jewelry and I get more compliments when I wear this bracelet. They are so unique and people just love them!
5,"Love my necklace. It's perfect. Definitely get one. Everywhere I go, people ask about it. 🥰"
5,I am absolutely thrilled with this! It’s classy. Simple. Elegant. The chain is almost invisible which spotlights the Swarovski crystal “diamond”. The stone sparkles! And when on my neck it lays well and does not twist or tangle. I am impressed and I do not impress easily. I will be ordering other pieces.
5,I cant stop ordering these! I am blessed to have expensive jewelry and I get more compliments when I wear these necklaces. They are so unique and people just love them!

Trop contente ! il correspond totalement à mes attentes, j'ai commandé le 8mm avec finition argenté, je ne quitte plus le collier, je dors avec et fait du sport avec, je le garde même sous la douche et il tient très bien.

Je vais le commander de nouveau en 6mm, pour le prix autant se faire plaisir.
Merci Creamelanie ^^"
5,I loved it! I get so many compliments 🥰
5,"Très jolie collier ,fait beaucoup d'effet .
Mélanie est super , très réactive , ça fait plaisir ! Merci encore une fois pour votre gentillesse. Je recommande cet article"
5,Je suis très satisfait de cet achat qui est un cadeau pour ma sœur. Le bijou m’a été envoyé très rapidement (malgré les conditions actuelles) et les contacts ont été très agréables. La qualité est superbe et conforme aux attentes.  C’est fin et c’est très joli. Je recommande !
5,"Livraison très rapide, beau produit pour un prix raisonnable. La vendeuse est à l'écoute et prend le temps de répondre, tout en personnalisant les commandes rapidement. Nous sommes très satisfaites de nos achats. Merci."
5,It is absolutely beautiful!! Exactly what I was hoping for-thank you so much!!
5,"Je recommande vivement, collier très joli avec ce cristal de Swarovski et de plus, je remercie Mélanie qui a été très compréhensible suite à mon erreur."
5,Très satisfaite ! Du plus bel effet. Vendeuse très à l'écoute et de très bon conseil. Pris en 8mm finition argent
5,"Le collier est encore plus beau en vrai ! Livraison rapide et créatrice à l'écoute, je recommande sans hésiter."
5,"Très joli collier féminin ! Mélanie répond hyper vite aux questions, envoi rapidement les achats qui sont bien joliment présentés. Bref parfait ! Merci pour tout."

5,"J'ai commandé ce collier le 10/11, il est en transit depuis le 14/11 et sa position n'a pas bougé!  Nous sommes le 20/11 et je ne l'ai toujours pas reçu! Inadmissible !!"
5,"Super beau, très rapide je suis super contente, je recommande fortement 😊"
5,"Ce collier est conforme à la photo. La pierre est brillante, c'est un joli bleu pour l'été. La longueur de 42 cm donne comme sur la photo. Je mets 4 étoiles car j'aurais aimé que le fil nylon soit plus épais. 
Merci pour vos créations."
5,Love it
5,"Merci Mélanie
Bien reçu, bien emballé, et tout mignon........"
5,"This is the second one I purchased.  The first was too small - my fault for not measuring right.  Gave it to my daughter and after seeing it on her I had to order one for me.  Its beautiful, simple, and sparkly.  I love it!"
5,I received my pendent today and it’s stunning!  It’s even more beautiful then I expected!  Seller let me know it might take longer to ship because of fewer planes I think she said. But Shipping was very fast considering it came from France to Florida.
5,"Très joli petit bijoux. Envoi très rapide dans un emballage soigné. Tout a été parfait. Je recommande vivement cette créatrice, bravo!"
5,"Le pendentif est très bien. C est l emballage qui laisse à désirer. Je veux l offrir à une relation de travail et il n y a même pas de carte de la créatrice. 
De plus on nous indique qu on peut joindre un mot avec le produit. Quelle ne fut pas ma déception de voir ce mot écrit à la main, sur un papier simple, découpé  avec un ciseaux cranteur.. Ça je peux le faire...
 En résumé je suis très déçue par la mise en valeur du produit..surtout de ne Pas avoir de carte de la créatrice. Je ne trouve pas ça normal, quand on achète sur etsy, ça me semble évident ! 
Ceci dit le collier est très bien et conforme à ce qui présenté. La livraison rapide."
5,Vendeur très sérieux ! jolie emballage et colis suivi. C'est une obligation qui devrait être mise en place par tous les vendeurs sur ETSY.
5,"Réalisées à ma demande en zirconium pour être assorties au collier que j'avais déjà reçu, ces boucles d'oreilles sont parfaites. Elégantes et réalisées avec soin, et toujours aussi joliment emballées.
Créatrice de bijoux recommandée."

La longueur correspond exactement à mes attentes, le cristal est vraiment magnifique, le fil très discret et l'attache nickel !
Je ne peux que recommander !
La créatrice et vendeuse est très attentionnée."
5,"Commande arrivée rapidement, emballage nickel et petit mot personnalisé qui fait toujours plaisir. Je recommande !
Merci d'etre pro. quelque soit le montant de la commande."
5,Ravie de mon achat! Je recommande
5,"Collier d'une grande finesse de réalisation. Très élégant pour un prix plus que doux. Envoi rapide, joliment emballé avec soin. Vendeuse charmante et réactive aux questions posées. J'ai dès réception du collier commandé des boucles d'oreilles tout aussi jolies ! Un grand merci."

5,"I am so happy with this purchase. Such a unique pair of earrings I have already gotten so many compliments. I also have to give props to the supplier. The holidays came with lots of delays beyond the suppliers control but I was given several updates throughout the delays which made me feel so much more at ease. I did not even have to reach out with questions, they were always one step ahead! Will be purchasing again."
5,"Outstanding experience!  Seller was responsive, pleasant and delivered spot-on customer service.  Product (2-piece geometric earrings) were just as described and presented online, plus my wife loved them as well (most important part).  The packaging (pull-tab box with Gold Spoon logo and light blue tie-closure jewelry bag also stamped with company logo) was professional and a nice touch!  I would definitely shop at Gold Spoon again, and recommend to others.  Thanks again for the great experience and outstanding product."

Very awesome artist too- I goofed and ordered the left earring when I needed the right, and she was so open to the exchange and it was super easy. Thanks Melanie!!"
5,"I love it!...might want to pierce the left just to wear another one of these. Just a suggestion, maybe a shorter post with a smoother/screw clasp...but still love what I got!"
5,The package is wonderful and thoughtful. This cartilage earring is by far the best earring i bought. It is not heavy and it looks good. Thank you
5,In love with this new piece! Even better in person!! Thank you!
5,Looks so cute in my cartilage. Have gotten so many compliments already. Also fast shipping :)
5,Love everything about this earring - very unique and well crafted!
5,"Wish it was bent just a tiny bit more so that it fit my ear a little better, but other than that I love it!"
5,"Beautiful earring, very well made. I had to send back to get the post moved down to sit better in my ear. Melanie was more than happy to fix my earring. She was fast with applying to message and fast shipping. I will definitely be ordering more jewelry from her"
5,Love the crawler. Fits ear great!
5,"sooo happy with my purchase!! beautiful item, excellent service, and super fast shippment. Cant wait to make business with you again (:"
5,My daughter love this piece! Lovely metal work and arrived quickly!

5,"I love the quality, just waiting for my ear to heal to wear this!"
5,beautifully made piece of art
5,Great quality and looks fantastic!
5,"This cute little earring shipped quickly and efficiently.  The only reason why I couldn't give it 5 stars was because it doesn't fit my ear like the photo (not the seller's fault) but my cartilage piercing must just be a little lower than the model's causing my arch to not lay flat as shown.  Besides that, it is well made, looks exactly like the photo, and is very sturdy and of good quality.  I have worn it a few times and gotten compliments on it, I just wish it fit my ear as perfectly as in the photo.  ;-)"
5,Thank u the earrings are soo very cool
5,"Fast shipping, great piece of jewelry!"
5,Love this earring! Only issue is that the back has to be on super tight so it doesn't move.
5,"Love it, fits well and looks really cool."
5,"Very subtle, so I can get away with wearing it at work. It sticks out just the TINIEST bit, but you can just move it back into place if need be (this mostly happens if you wear the earring to bed or have long hair); otherwise it's great!"
5,I have worn this every day since I received it. I love it!
5,I like this item a lot but it's hard to stay in place
5,"Doesn't quite fit in the upper part of my ear like in the picture, but that's my ear, not the earring. The jewelry itself is lovely, and perhaps I'll just buy another and wear them in my lobes instead. 😄"
5,"Article conforme à la description avec un très joli packaging, et livré très rapidement."
5,I was looking for something new and different - this was perfect!
5,Loved the item exactly what was shown and described.
5,"Beautiful, unusual piece. Shipped quickly."
5,"Great quality and unique piece of jewelry. It fits well into the shape of the ear and does not budge.

The only reason why I give it 4 stars is beacause the piece is actually a lot darker than shown in the pictures. I thought that it was a lot less oxidized than it actually is. It's almost black and not shiny at all. (The flash used in the pictures reflected on the silver made me thought it was)"
5,Perfect. Thank you so much.
5,Got this for my mom for mother's day she loved it! Very well made.
5,Very beautiful and very will made.
5,Thank you very much! :)
5,"Exactly as pictured, works great for my cartilage piercing!"
5,Perfect in every way. Thank you.
5,"Very cute, thought it would be a little longer down my ear, seems shorter than the picture shows - but besides that a very nice piece of jewlery. :)"
5,"a gorgeous earring, thank you"
5,"Send quickly, 
beautiful, exactly what i expected ! :)"
5,A+++++++ fast shipper. Item as described.
5,"Cute, and I really did love it.  It fit well.  Only problem is that the back was loose and it fell off the first time I wore it and I lost it. :("
5,Arrived on time and just as described.
5,I did send two emails but got no reply to the second one
5,"Love these! Unique, shipped quickly, and I am already getting compliments after wearing for the first time. Love love love!"
5,These are my first ear climbers and I LOVE them!!

5,Love these! They are so pretty. Great customer service too!
5,"Packaged adorably, easy to put on, & perfect just as the pictures show! LOVE these earrings."

5,Super cute! Definitely happy with my purchase
5,Shipping was fast and the earrings are beautiful! Great seller
5,"Super cute, quick shipping"
5,"These are really cute. They’re not quite as long as I anticipated, but they’re still lovely. I can’t attest to fit and comfortability yet, as they are a Christmas gift for my daughter. Shipping was incredibly fast and the earring came packaged nicely."
5,So Cute!! Wrapped in a box with a ribbon.  Wonderful!!! Thank you.
5,"Very pretty earrings, well made"
5,"The earrings looked nice and shipped on time.  They're a little bit smaller than I was expecting, but that's my fault for not looking more closely at the measurements.  Just an FYI to anyone else who might have wanted longer crawlers."
5,These were so cute! Unfortunately they were too long for my ears (I have child sized ears) and that was my fault for not reading the measurements but they would have been perfect if they fit.
5,Wonderful thank you....
5,Very nice. Just as pictured.
5,"the ear pins are so beautifull in person, very unique design, my sister love them !! shipping was quick and packaging is over the top ;-) would buy again for sure !!"
5,"I LOVE these ear pins.  They are very unique, and I got several compliments the very first time I wore them.  Emmanuela is SO good at communication, she even was able to tell me a package had been lost before I realized it.  She shipped a new pair immediately and it arrived (in Florida) from Greece in just 3 days.  I would definitely recommend this seller (and artist!) without reservation.  I've just never experienced such prompt communication in probably a hundred transactions!"
5,"These earrings are even more gorgeous in person! They are comfortable to wear (I've never worn earrings like this before, so I wasn't sure!)! Any time I wear them, I get compliments! Thank you!!!"
5,"The ear pins are very pretty and give a special look.
They took a little longer in the mail due to the winter storms but I am happy with the purchase."
5,I love these earrings. I was alittle nervous at first because I have very sensitive ears but I didnt have an allergic reaction at all. I always get complimented on them. They cute dressed up or down. I use them as my everyday simple jewelry.
5,Love them!!!
5,"Love it I am wearing it like an earring not a cuff, it is easier to put it on , looks pretty too !!"
5,My everyday earring. I love love love this. Simple enough for every day but nice enough for a dressed up occasion. Will definitely buy again.
5,The earrings have exceeded my expectations and arrived in perfect condition thanks to the cute packaging. Great marketing! Thank you again.
5,Beautiful earrings! They are very comfortable to wear. Emmanuela was also a pleasure to work with and was always available for questions. Great shop!
5,Love these! All came beautifully wrapped as well. Will be buying more in the future!
5,These are dainty and a bit badass at the same time.  They are very light and comfortable.   Delivery was super fast with lovely packaging.  Thank you.
5,"Service was amazing! Emmanuela really blew me away by her personal touches and follow up on the order. I am not sure I've ever received such great service from an online sale. The cuff earrings are great, but what was also very impressive was that they came nicely packaged - even with a bag from her shop. It was if I'd just walked out of her store with my purchase :)

Love it and will definitely be buying from her again."
5,Fantastic rose gold ear cuff. Beautifully and thoughtfully presented. Quick delivery. A first class seller with an eye for detail. Thank you very much!

Thank you very much! If needed, you can also message me to confirm my recommendation for the seller. She is incredible person. :)"
5,3rd pair of earrings and no complaints.   Beautifully made.  Package came quickly and very securely wrapped.   The jewelry and packaging -  perfect gifts.    Don’t even think about it - just order.   You won’t be disappointed 👌😀

5,Very nice earrings! Will shop again
5,Item was shipped on time!
5,"I love the earings as they look modern and very pretty. BUT they fall out very quickly and can get lost. I know I lost one in the hospital.
The staff all felll in love with the remaining one and I am hoping the lost one will be returned."
5,"It got shipped out WAY sooner than promised - a nice surprise! They feel very delicate, I had thought I might wear these quite often (they are very beautiful but I *think* understated enough to do so), but I am afraid of breaking them. One fits my ear better than the other but the directions were very clear and I don’t think it will be a problem (must be something with me, I imagine, as all bodies are different). Overall very impressed"
5,beautiful! Just right for the wedding outfit that I wore.
5,So beautiful - tons of compliments! Easy to wear and stay put.
5,I chose these earrings for my wedding. So beautiful.
5,Simply beautiful ! Thanks a lot.
5,Honestly really obsessed with these earrings. I was worried they wouldn’t stay in place or they would be uncomfortable but I was wrong on both accounts. I have pretty sensitive ears and I haven’t noticed any issues with that either. These are really pretty and I would highly recommend them.
5,My daughter wore these on her wedding day and they were stunning! You won’t be disappointed!
5,"These are really beautiful - am planning on wearing for my wedding.  Everything arrived quickly and came with instructions.  They are lightweight without feeling cheap, so I will be able to wear them for the whole day."
5,Such a beautiful design! Easy to use and wear.
5,Earrings are beautiful! Perfect gift for the holidays
5,very pretty and very fast delivery
5,Boyfriend loves his new earrings!
5,Absolutely gorgeous and unique earrings! So happy with every purchase I've made from this shop. Super helpful and friendly communication :)
5,I know these say they're for men but I ordered them for myself.  I wear them 5 days out of the week and get so many compliments.  They are the perfect size when you want something basic and fun.
5,I'm so impressed with the quality and originality of these earrings. Subtle but makes a statement. My girlfriend loves them and candyfoxx provided such a great customer service experience that I will definitely be buying from her shop in the future.
5,"Beautiful piece, and it traveled all the way from Lithuania to US. Worth the wait"
5,"Nice earrings, finally something else than just round and black. Received the package within one week (Netherlands)."
5,These are probably my favorite earrings
5,Bought these for my boyfriend! Very simple and sleek!
5,Love them. Thank you so much.
5,"L'article a été envoyé très rapidement, la vendeuse m'a même envoyé un message pour me dire que le colis était partis.
Les boucles sont superbes, elles paraissent un peu moins épaisses sur les photos mais rien de dérangeant. A acheté sans hésité."
5,The earrings are larger and made of cheaper quality than expected.
5,"The earrings were not entirely what I had expected. The picture maybe have misrepresented the thickness and actual design of the earrings to some extend but that is still generally accetable. What I am displeased would be the use of arcylic paint as it is not entirely water-proof but instead only what resistant, hence the white overlay may come off over time. The use of enamel paint or another water proof paint would have been better. 

Overall an alright product."
5,"These earrings are absolutely stunning! Quality craftsmanship and even more gorgeous in person. I am not one to leave reviews, but this earrings were totally worth the wait. I am so delighted with this purchase and this seller! I loved all the little details in the packaging too. It is obvious that the Artikats truly cares about the details from start to finish."
5,"Love it! Just got one side, so I can use some of my other singles on the other ear. :)"
5,Tellement jolie ! Super contente de ce bijou ! Je recommande à 100%

5,Loved them! everyday wear. Shipping was around 2 weeks here to US but its expected coming from Greece. Thank you!
5,"By far one the best gifts I have bought for myself. The earrings arrived on time, the design is so pretty and most of all sooooo comfortable. I wear them when I work, when I'm at the gym, when I'm asleep I actually tend to forget I'm wearing them. I definitely recommend this piece if you are looking for climber earrings. Vasilia is such a kind person and she really cares about her work, you shall not regret a purchase from her store."

5,"I love these earrings, they are so pretty! They won't stay on though, but I see that my piercing is a bit low on the earlobe so I can't really blame the earrings for that. Shipped on time, and a super sweet seller. Would definitely recommend!"
5,These are gorgeous and I love them! I've had many compliments already. Thank you
5,"Love these, fits my ear lobes and great for everyday use."

5,"Really beautiful earnings as described. They are a bit more sturdy then I expected, which I really liked as I don’t feel afraid of them breaking easily. 

From the beginning I had some trouble keeping the earnings steady on my ear. However the seller helped me figure out how to make  earnings sit tight on my ear.   The trick was to get it tight at the side where the piercing is. Thank you for your service and some lovely earrings!"
5,"Very beautiful earrings, looks good, fits perfect. It's no trouble putting them on (I was a bit afraid it should be, but it's not...) I'm very happy with them."

Expédition très rapide, emballage soigné et attentionné avec petit sachet et petit mot + facture de la part d'Elianor, qualité indéniable du plaqué or et de la boucle dans son ensemble qui tient très bien sur l'oreille, une  belle surprise pour cette créatrice chez qui je commanderai de nouveau !"
5,"J'avais des doutes sur la tenue de ce type de bijoux d'oreille mais après avoir échangé avec la vendeuse qui est très à l'écoute j'ai passé ma commande et je ne suis pas déçue : après le crash test de la journée de travail et la séance de sport ça ne bouge pas! Top
De plus l'envoi est plus que rapide. Merci :)"
5,"Magnifique, très bien finies et originales.  Je suis très heureuse de mon achat."
5,Très jolies boucles fines. Je les ai reçues très rapidement. Ravie de mon achat.

5,"Très jolies boucles d'oreille, fines et de belle qualité. Envoi rapide dans un joli petit paquet."
5,"Ma sœur les trouvent très jolies, mais regrettent qu’elles ne tiennent pas suffisamment. Il faut constamment être vigilante pour ne pas les perdre."
5,Cadeau d'anniversaire. A bcp plu.
5,Beautiful product. Only gave shipping a 1 star because there was such a long delay in receiving the product (this May have been due to Covid-19 disruptions)
5,"Like someone else mentioned, I didn't know exactly what I was ordering but I LOVE these earrings. There's no back on them. It just twists through and you can't even feel that you're wearing them. And they look unique and very cute.  Nice design! Received 2 weeks from order date."
5,I am in love with these! So unique and beautiful. I just received silver today and I am ordering gold today as well! LUV them!
5,I love them! Just as pictured/described!
5,Simple yet unique design. These are the first earrings I’ve had that didn’t give me an allergic response. I guess titanium is for those like me who have an allergy to most metals. I’m elated to have finally found this out after years of irritation and searching. I’ve also showered and slept in them with no issues. Thank you!
5,I love the earrings. I have terrible metal allergies and these have been in for over a week with no irritation. They are comfortable to sleep in and I get a lot of compliments. My only complaint is shipping took weeks! If you are good to wait and wait they are a great purchase.
5,"I tried to take a picture that shows what the earrings look like in and out. These are awesome! They're super comfy and easy to put in and take off. I even where them to bed and working out. They do take a while from order time to arrival, which is definitely to be expected of such high-quality handmade pieces. Not a criticism! Just something to consider when figuring out when to purchase :)"
5,"Exactly as advertised, super comfortable and really easy to dress up or dress down!"
5,Love these. Very unique - get asked about them a lot. Shipping fast.  Earrings are quality work. I ordered titanium to try them out but now I'll order gold. I can even sleep in these which I love. Thanks
5,"I love these earrings so much! They are so subtle but beautiful. Always get a compliment when i wear them. It was a little tricky getting them on at first, but you eventually get the hang of it. Would definitely recommend!"
5,"Love these! Exactly what I was looking for, perfect fit."
5,"I do love the design, but with long hair sometimes I find my hair getting caught quite a bit and occasionally the back will curl out. But other then those minor things I love it."
5,Der Versand nach Deutschland dauerte 2 1/2 Wochen. Umso größer war die Freude beim auspacken. Die Ohrringe passen sehr gut und piecksen auch beim liegen nicht unangenehm. Zu Weihnachten wird bestimmt noch das ein oder andere Paar verschenkt.
5,Just got these and live them. Great quality and so pretty
5,Simple but pretty! Love it!
5,I love these so much!!! Simple yet beautiful
5,"Took me a minute to figure out how to put them on, but once I did - really liked the way they look.  Unique and good quality too."
5,"Loved these earrings! I wasn’t expecting it to be one piece but it was a nice surprise as I tend to lose backs on ones that are separate! Also, they are solid silver which is nice for my extremely sensitive ears! Thank you for a beautiful product!"
5,I wasn't exactly sure what I had purchased when the earrings arrived but I have been wearing them ever since and I love them! I was able to put them on easier than I thought I would and I must say they are like wearing nothing - super light and comfortable. Nice craftsmanship - thank you!
5,"These are cute, easy to put on, and virtually weightless. I love that they dont have a traditional earring back. It takes a second to figure out how to thread it onto your ear but once you get it it’s easy. They look great stacked with other earrings."
5,"Beautiful, dainty and exceeded my expectations! 😁"
5,SO SO Great!  Love these earrings and i'll shop here again for sure.  Thank you.
5,"Very nice, worth the wait. They do not bother my ears and are comfortable. I'm excited that I can wear earrings again! And these are so fun and cute!"
5,Love these earrings! They are exactly what I expected (which often means a lot on Etsy). Very comfortable to sleep in which is important tome because I am lazy. They also don’t bother my sensitive earlobes!
5,Unique and dainty! Just as I wanted. I’ve received lots of compliments already.
5,"Not quite as bright and shiney a silver it looks in photo, but nice design and happy with it overall"
5,I love these earrings - so simple yet very elegant and unique. I've received so many compliments- I wear them all the time!
5,I love these. They're surprisingly easy to put in and I've already gotten a bunch of compliments on them.

5,Love these earrings! They are comfortable and very stylish! Unlike anything else I own!
5,"Received this item on May 7, 2018.
Absolutely the cutest little earrings I have ever seen. Dainty little things. Appear well made, you just twist them in your ear and go, that simple. So simple, so cute and so dainty. Just awesome. Love them. Very good price."
5,Really cute earrings - just as pictured. I got them in gold and love them
5,Simple and pretty! Happy to purchase from a creator.
5,"Cute earrings! Item didn’t ship in promised timeline and seller was slow to respond to messages, but I’m still happy with the item"
5,I do like these earrings. I wasn't expecting the one-piece design (thought it was a front circle with post and a circle on the back fastener/jacket).  But the twist on design is easy to put on and I do like the look of these earrings when wearing them.  Glad I purchased.
5,So understated and delicate but gorgeous!
5,"I am new to discovering hypoallergenic jewelry. Like most with limited knowledge of hypoallergenic jewelry, I historically gave up on jewelry. I feel so lucky to have stumbled upon this seller! I purchased these earrings and I feel so grateful. Not only to do they not hurt my ears *at all* (which has never happened for me) they are backless earrings. They're light-weight, comfortable, and no tugs or pokes behind the ears from the back of the earring. I may never take these off!"
5,"This is a really lovely item. It was a little hard the first time I worn them, but then was easy after that. The earrings look great on."
5,These earrings are really interesting and I love them! Thank you so much!
5,"Love them. Simple, unique, timeless."
5,The wire is a little thinner than expected but still they look great
5,Holy sh*t - I love these earrings!
5,"Die Ohrringe sind schnell versendet worden und gefallen mir sehr gut! 
Sehr schlichtes, minimalistisches Design!"
5,These earings are just beautiful! They are unusual and delicate. These where a B-Day gift for my 16 year old daughter and a total hit. Thank you!!

5,"Unique design, expected better quality."
5,Got these as a gift for my friend and she loves them and wears them all the time!
5,"Great design, nice gift box, and shipped in a reasonable time!"
5,Extremely slow to ship. No response to message. Unprofessional seller.
5,"Regrettably, these earrings looked by cheap for gold filled.  The looked like earrings could buy at any retail store and saved the shipping.  I am so sorry to give it such a low score.  Perhaps you could shine up the gold or somehow make it look better."
5,I did not receive my order.........
5,This is my second pair of aspera earrings and I’m obsessed. I love minimalist jewelry and theirs is unique and beautiful. Thank you.
5,Beautiful!
5,"I really love my earrings. They arrived quickly in eco-friendly packaging (love that). Also I have had another style of this earring and it fell out. However, this style is great, stays in place and it will not fall out. Overall a great product :) WIll shop at this store again soon."
5,Simple and beautiful earrings. Love them.
5,These were a lot smaller than I was expecting it they are really cute. Great quality.
5,"Super cute earrings, but more importantly I was shocked by how comfortable they are, nothing pokes into your head like the backs of normal earrings. The only issue I have is that they can definitely fall out easily so be careful if you are for some reason moving around on a bed 🤷🏼‍♀️"
5,They are perfect. thank you!
5,So fine and delicate.  Shipped on time with care.
5,Love them so much! So dainty. I’ve received so many compliments. Super fast shipping too!

I’ve worn them twice now since getting them a month ago, and I think the last time I wore earrings before that was almost a year ago. I’m excited to buy more from this shop!"
5,Simple yet elegant! I love these and the fact the hail from the Northwoods is all the better!
5,"Adore these! Arrived quickly, quality material and stay firmly in place. A little bit smaller than I anticipated but after wearing the thinner look works!"
5,"I love these earrings! However, they are a touch long for the countour my ear, though that is not the fault of the product. Still wearable, and I will wear them happily! Thank you!"
5,Awesome! I’ve gotten tons of compliments. Thanks so much!
5,These are so lovely. I like how they are unique and subtle. Thank you💛

5,"I love this climber. I got a pair but wear them one at a time, I just wanted the option to switch sides. I get a lot of compliments on them and will be ordering another pair for my mother!"

5,I really like tge simplisty and style.
5,"I purchased these for my sister in rose gold, and she loved them! They are well made and just as described.

They look awesome and now I want a pair! :) I would definitely recommend these!"
5,I love these earrings! So elegant !
5,"These are lovely, minimalist earrings.  I receive lots of compliments on them."
5,Very cute and simple. Love how they aren't super long and crawl up the whole ear. Thank you!
5,Owner was awesome and love these
5,"Really Cool earring. They look really nice in the right ear because the curve goes with the natural curve of your ear. My one complaint is that the left ear doesn't curve the right direction. Basically, you get two right ear, earrings. Still pretty though and I will still wear. But i wish the left fit like the right.

UPDATE: After posting this review, the seller kindly offered to send me a new pair of earrings as they should have been made one for each ear. Five stars for customer service!

Thanks so much!"
5,It is just as pictured and arrived quickly.  Love it!
5,Shipped fast! Got these for my mom since she saw I was wanting a pair and I gave them to her for her birthday. She loves them!
5,"Simple & elegant. Note to self (and others) : don't loose the plastic backs to these earrings, it helps them stay securely on and in place!"
5,"I love these earrings. They are very subtle and the rose gold ones blend in with my skin color, but they are very pretty. They slip occasionally, but mostly if they catch on my hair."
5,I really like the look of these. My only compliant is they tend to slip often.
5,Beautiful item and arrived right away. I've already had compliments!
5,Very elegant and delicate.  Great quality and workmanship.
5,t and love the earrings
5,I love these! The fit great and i can’t wait to wear them all the time!
5,"Beautifully designed and crafted earrings that look even better on. Little disappointed in the packaging as they were a gift but again, the product was top notch!"
5,"These earrings are cute, stylish and modern. I have really sensitive ears so I purchased the sterling silver pair hoping that they would not cause an irritation, but that was not the case. I’m not sure if these are sterling silver plated or pure sterling silver, but if you have sensitive ears they may not work for you."
5,"My cousin absolutely loved these and wears them all the time, best birthday gift ever."
5,"My cousin absolutely loved these and wears them all the time, best birthday gift ever."
5,"I bought this to wear in my 3rd hole on one ear. It looks super cute, and is the right length to stay in place without disappearing all the way up my ear. My only issue is that it sometimes spins off of my ear when the back gets caught in my hair. I wish is didn't have the small bent part on the back."
5,Cute earrings. Very small and dainty. I must have a larger ear lobe because they look much smaller on me.
5,They arrived quickly and look just as pictured. Think my friend will be happy with her Christmas gift!
5,Lovely little earrings. Thank you!
5,"I love these earrings! I will say that shipping was exceptionally slow, with no tracking info shared, and the seller could have been more responsive. That said, the product was worth it!!

**EDIT, these have become my favorite jewelry I’ve ever owned and have held up extremely well with being slept in and worn constantly. So worth it!!!"
5,💖 love it
5,I love all moon jewelry this earrings is next in my collection 😍
5,"I am in love with these earrings. They also have an adjustable post (on the dangling piece) to accommodate short or long earlobes - so thoughtful! I also received a small gift in addition to the order. These are handmade pieces, so expect some time for your delivery, but it was worth the wait! <3"
5,So beautiful and unique! Fantastic quality and craftsmanship! I know these will get tons of compliments! Thanks!

5,I love these so much! Thank you!
5,"They are beautiful... and were my new favorite earrings, but after only wearing them for a few days (never in my sleep) they are turning colors and one of my posts has already broken off.  Maybe I just have really bad luck, but I won't be spending 100 dollars on another pair.

Edit: Owner offered to fix the earring and is very responsive, thanks!"
5,"These earring are super duper rad and well made......buuuuut they turn my ears a color so I’m not quite sure the whole earring is sterling silver. In any case, this probably won’t deter me from by one of the other cool designs."
5,"Grossière 
Je vais changer la boucle d’oreille qui est trop grosse."
5,"The earrings are beautiful.  The only reason I am giving 4 stars and not 5 stars is that I had said I wanted my order cancelled if it wouldn't get here by Christmas.  It was a miracle that it did make it here on Christmas Eve, but I would have been extremely upset if it wasn't here by Christmas.  If you have a deadline for something I wouldn't order these unless you have well over a month for them to get to you.  They have to go through customs and there is not telling how long that will take.  But if you have time to get the jewelery then her stuff is absolutely beautiful and I would highly recommend it."
5,"Really well made, substantial ear-rings. Will definitely shop with this seller again."
5,"Lovely earrings, could have done with another hole option for the rear post though!"
5,"So beautiful, can’t wait to wear them!"
5,"After asking she could not supply tracking info. I did receive the earrings about 3 weeks later. I'm allergic to metals except for .925 Sterling Silver, and is how the earrings are described and the reason outside of loving the design I purchased them. After 2 days of wear, my ear lobes started to itch, swell and, the earrings discolored. I'm sorry I didn't request what other metals were used. My advice to the shop owner is please describe all metals used in jewelry, get shipping info for your customers, especially for international orders."
5,These earrings are amazing! I didn't want anything too big just simple and dainty and these earrings are exactly that! So happy with my purchase and so happy with the quality. Thanks again!

5,Absolutely beautiful and well made earrings - they have become a daily favorite!
5,"I feel sorry but it's a real deception : I don't know if my ear lobes are too thin or if i put the earrings in the wrong way but they don't stay in place as climbers!
Furthermore, the delivery was just rubbish (only due to French post service)"
5,I get compliments all the time! Obsessed :)

5,Very delicate (in a good way); seller even included a gift box!
5,"It shipped on time, and I love these! They're very pretty, and look good on me. The only problem I had was trying to put them in. Perhaps instructions should come with orders? Nevertheless, these are amazing!"

These earrings are dainty and adorable, and they are great quality. Plus, they came in the cutest wrappings! I can't wait to give these as a gift! I would definitely recommend, but make sure to leave ample time for shipping."
5,Such great quality earrings! I absolutely love them. They are just a tiny bit too big for my ear shape but I don’t mind too much. And it didn’t take too long to get to me.
5,"These are my first ear climbers and they're so cute! I bought them for my birthday since I'm a Cancer. I like the shop's astrology constellation and birthstone ear climber collections.

The earrings arrive in a tiny glass bottle (think 1"") with a cork to keep them safe & in shape. Make sure to pinch the back firmly enough for the ear climber to stay put, but loose enough to be comfortable."
5,"These earrings are beyond expectations. Now are my favourite earrings. They are easy to wear, confortable and well made. The package is sooo cute. Perfect transaction. Thank you❤️Deserved five stars🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"
5,Absolutely love them! So cute and packaged well!
5,"Initially awkward to put on, but now I have got the hang of it (I had to refer to the pics). Nevertheless, this was the most accurate Cancer Zodiac Constellation earrings that I found (6 stars, rather than 5). 10/10 for the tracked DHL courier delivery to the UK."
5,So gorgeous and fits perfectly on the ear. Love!
5,These are beautiful!
5,I love my astrological new pin earrings. I am getting great compliments.

5,Love the earrings but unsure if they are sterling silver all the way through because the holes in my ears got irritated. Bummer
5,"Took over a month to receive the product. Contact the shop owner as I had ordered to give as a Christmas gift. I was told that there were messages on the shop page that said that I had to order by November 13th to get by Christmas which I hadn't found. I received the product and it is complete garbage. Seriously like toy jewelry, so disgusted with it."
5,"I love them! They shipped quickly, and look just how I imagined. I got the rose gold, and it is gorgeous."

I have to say for the sake of anyone else on here thinking about purchasing them though, I wish I hadn't. I found them on wish literally the next day, and with shipping I would have paid $1.95 for them instead. I received them quickly, and they were exactly as pictured,  just wish I had saved my money and looked elsewhere before paying $14 for them."
5,Love them.
5,These shipped pretty quickly. I've gotten lots of compliments already. I wish the bar part of the earrings were a little smaller/thinner and that the lotus flower a little thinner but I'm pretty happy with these earrings.

5,"Came pretty quick but I ordered several and they all just came in a bag, not on a paper holder.  I'll have make something to give them as gifts."
5,"The earrings shipped quickly but weren’t great quality at all, I definitely expected more for the price. I got a pack of 8 of the same earrings from Amazon - very similar quality, in fact I think nearly exactly the same (somewhat suspiciously) for $10."
5,For the price the quality doesn’t feel adequate
5,"Too bad I can't dowload a pic of these ears. Manufacturing effects, dotted surface material, bended ..."

Better buy old navy or other stores. Really bad craftmanship, not look as a picture. 
One star for quick shipping"

5,Extremely thin and very easily broken
5,I have not received this.
5,so in love with this earring!!!
5,"These were a gift for my mom for Christmas. She loved them! They were beautiful and of great quality! I like that the back earring is a separate piece from the front earring. It has different holes so you can adjust depending on your lobe size. You just have to be careful when taking them off, because you have three separate pieces to keep track of (the front earring, the hanging earring, and the backing)!"
5,They're finally here! They took about 20 days to come in because of the corona virus but they are perfect. Exactly like they were pictured and the sparkle is just beautiful. Thank you Lia!!!
5,"Lovely product, had many people complimenting me on my new earrings and very fast delivery, will be back for more in the future!
If I can make only a small suggestion for less packaging, it was nice but would personally preferred it simpler or more eco friendly.
thank you x"

5,"These earrings are super cute! 5 stars because they are exactly as shown and great quality. However, I realized this style isn't for me as it kind of pinches my ears and there are 3 different pieces, making them a bit more complicated to put in than another earring."
5,I love this little ear jacket so much! It's simple and wearable and so so pretty
5,"Gorgeous, unique & exactly as advertised. Quick responses from owner. Quick shipping to SE USA. I will be making future purchases."

Now I quote the seller's words when he replied my question about ""Multicolor"": ""When I make a pair of pinwheel earrings in multicolor the color shades are blue - violet - gold at the bottom of the windmill and gold - teal on the top."" So the real products don't really have the same look as in the picture, but they are still beautiful, with ombre effect ;)"

Plus the phenomenal packaging - they come in a great little box, with anti tarnish strip, and the earrings are clipped onto a tree slice, words don't do it justice but it's fancy and perfect if you're wanting to gift these to someone very lucky! Photo doesn't do the box justice. I am pleased (very pleased!) with this purchase and highly recommend the seller."
4,These earrings are absolutely beautiful! I am in love with them! I just received them yesterday and I have already gotten a couple compliments on them too! Amazing! :-)

4,shipping was fast and spot on!  handcrafting is beautiful just love it.
4,"This earrings couldn't be anymore awesome. They came nicely placed in a little wooden slice, with a piece of polishing cloth and an anti-tarnish paper. The work is delicate, excelent, and the overall look is super dainty and elegant. I love them, and I'm sure I will be back in the future, totally recommended shop!"
4,"These earrings are more beautiful than the picture shows! Love to wear them together or apart, I've chosen the small circle with the earcuff and it's gorgeous. I'll totally buy again from this shop :)"
4,These lovely tiny earrings arrived earlier than expected! What a joy! I love them! Very very fast delivery to germany! Thank you!
4,"After a lot of shipping headaches, not due to Laura..I received my lovely jackets and just love them. Very nicely made and a good size. Highly recommend Laura’s beautiful creativity and workmanship!"
4,"Absolutely love this; beautiful, delicate, unique. Came in an exquisite package: mounted on a cross-section of wood, in a paper box with a handy silver polishing cloth. Looking forward to buying again soon!"
4,"Really Beautiful! Just as pictured and the packaging was a beautiful bonus. My ONLY disappointment is not quality or service related and can't remedied without custom work, but I want to mention it so you are aware. When wearing these earrings as pictured here, the back piece hangs down more than I'd like it to on MY ears. This is due to the position of the hole in my ear and consequently a narrow lobe. However, this may not be the case for your ears. I was just hoping the back piece would 'cup' my ear, not hang down so low. I still love them and wear them the other way! They were worth the wait and actually arrived sooner than I expected, considering where they came from (I'm in the US). So, still an all around 5 Stars."
4,So beautiful! Love them
4,"Mix and match with my stud earrings. Well worth it, and just really beautifully made."
4,Love love love these earrings
4,Love these earrings.  Fit beautifully with diamond studs.  Great for everyday and evening.  Comfortable enough to wear for days on end.

4,Absolutely beautiful. I've had so many comments about them.

Liebevoll und toll verpackt mit der Baumscheibe. 😊
Der Versand nach Deutschland erfolgte auch sehr schnell."
4,"These are beautifully done. I have large earlobes, so could have handled them a little larger, but I love them anyway! They are super cute in person!"
4,Very nice high quality artisan earrings! Highly recommend!
4,I adore these! They're gorgeous. Thank you and bravo for the exquisite craftsmanship.
4,I LOVE this jewelry! So dainty but not too dainty - very feminine - you won't be disappointed!
4,"Fast delivery shipping! 
The earrings are really well done and simply beautiful!
Wow packaging!!!!!! 
Thank u so much!"
4,"I really love these. As far as earring jackets go they are pretty unique in design/pattern and I really like that. Honestly,  I find them a little pricey compared to what I am used to paying in the U.S. even from handmade artisans, but not a ton, and their uniqueness was enough to make me want to buy them anyway. Quality was great. If the prices went down a little I'd probably buy a lot more but can't say I would at this time priced as they were when I bought them."
4,"What we got was exactly as described on line. My wife was very pleased with the gift. The process of ordering and receiving the jacket earrings was straightforward and easy.
If my wife drops additional hints for CookOnStrike, I'm sure I'll follow through."
4,These earrings are very well made - better than what you find in the stores these days. Laura takes a lot of care packaging them and even including a cleaning cloth. Thank you Laura!

4,"These earrings are absolutely beautiful, unfortunately the jacket is a little too long and it hangs too far below my earlobe instead of being just underneath; I still wear them anyway because I think they are absolutely stunning. I may try the sunburst jackets next sold by the owner. Shipping was fantastic and the owner is absolutely great. Will purchase from this store again!"
4,Love them!
4,"Once again, this shop doesn't disappoint! My second pair of jackets and have another pair of studs to mix it up. Love the ear jackets, so cute and fun!"
4,"I cannot say enough good things about this purchase! Catie was super helpful with all of my questions. She didn't bat an eyelash (at me anyway) when I accidentally listed the wrong shipping address and the first set of earrings had to be returned to sender. And my earrings came today and I love them SO much, I know they'll be my go-tos. Have already picked my next set of jackets."

4,I bought these earrings for my bridesmaids to wear in my wedding in May this year. They are so beautiful and feminine. I love the hammered stud and the ear jacket's beaded-look  really ties it together. I can't wait to give them these earrings!
4,"Look even better than the picture! Very cool. 

Delivery fast and seller was easy to work with."
4,"I LOVE these earrings! They are so stylish, affordable, and go with everything. When the first back piece didn't fit, Catie was nice enough to  switch them out for smaller ones. This shop has great service, and lots of stylish pieces."

4,My gf loves them. Thanks!
4,Thank you - these are great!
4,These are exactly as described and seem to be well made
4,"I love these earrings!!!!  At first they didn't stay in a climbing position but that's because I got the 7 stone climbers and my upper ears are both thin and narrow. I have issues with all climbers because of my ears. I worked with the store and she was amazing to work with. Margay walked me through how to adjust them and they work!!! They stay in a climbing position! I love these earrings, great quality, super great customer service and fast shipping. Will be purchasing from this shop again for certain."
4,"Love love love my custom ear climbers! Super helpful shop. Wonderful customer service, and beautiful product. Many thanks!"
4,I am obsessed with these!! Thank you SO much! 💫💫💫
4,"This shop is AMAZING!! The original climbers were about 2 stones too big, and they offered to make me a new set with 2 less stones. And now they are PERFECT!! I will definitely buy more items from this shop because they obviously care about the happiness of their customers. Thank you so much for being so awesome!!!!!"
4,Stunning earrings. They go with so many outfits. I feel so feminine when I wear them. They are also very easy to put on!
4,Love this ! Very cute !
4,Amazing!
4,Love the earrings! Micah and Tiffany also included some hypoallergenic rubber earring backs with the earrings which are really helpful.
4,So cute and super-fast shipping!
4,"Wonderful item, love the earrings and have had several positive comments when wearing them."
4,I love them but it is a bit of a struggle keeping them up on your ear.
4,Just as described! It looks great! A lot of people have been asking where I've gotten them!
4,"It's beautiful, comfortable, stays in place, and exactly as pictured! It also is one of the few earrings I can wear that doesn't irritate my sensitive ears.  I love it and have gotten so many compliments on it already.  Thank you Kristen!"
4,Obsessed with these.
4,"The rose gold ear climbers are a beautiful color just as I hoped.  They stay in place quite well.  Sometimes my hair catches them but that's the life with a lot of crazy waves.  They go up almost half way up my ear, were easy to put in and they are classy and funky with out being ""too much"" to wear to an office, interview, etc.  They arrived quickly and were packaged nicely.  I would purchase from Glamrock again."
4,"I love these so much. I get compliments constantly. And my first pair, in rose gold which I still have, have held up for years while often being thrown in my purse. They haven't bent or broken. Loved them so much, had to get a gold pair too."
4,These earrings are gorgeous!  I get constant compliments on them.  They require a little fiddling and squeezing to get them to stay in place.
4,"These are so unique and beautiful, but with a little edge for my rehearsal dinner.  I love them!"
4,"Big, but they look very nice! ♥"
4,"Arrived just as pictured, and very quick shipping.  These are so neat, and very very light. Almost like wearing studs in terms of weight. Thank you!"
4,Love these. Thank you. Great quality
4,Beautiful color and fast shipping.
4,"Item exactly as described, just what I was looking for!  Fast shipping and nicely packaged 💚"
4,"Very pretty, but craftsmanship is not as refined as I'd hoped. The metal stud that goes through your ear has a blunt cut, which I didn't expect for the price."
4,Bought as a gift. Daughter loves them.
4,quick replies from seller when i needed to change sizes - they made is super quick and easy! love my ring
4,The design of this necklace is simple but so stylish. I like it so much. It also looks so sophisticated that I often enjoy wearing it. It matches with various type of clothes. Thanks a lot.
4,Love all the variety sizes of rings for my skinny fingers. Thank you! ❤️
4,"Absolutely, great piece!!!  It’s different from what you usually see on jewelry .  It has a modern air and at the same time 70 ‘ style. Like a lot the mixture of greens"
4,Items arrived safely and quickly.  So very pleased with my purchases and hope to do business again - for sure! Merci!
4,Love this piece!  Thanks so much! Looking forward to doing business again!

4,Lovely item. Arrived promptly and safely.
4,Stunning ear rings. This was a present for our daughter and she loves them.
4,"Lovely earrings and fast delivery, thank you."
4,This set is beautiful!! I got the right ear climber and the left as the standard earring. I cannot wait to wear these on my wedding day! The ear climber cuff/clip has this thing in the back to help tighten it to the desired fit which is awesome. It also came with a Swarovski Crystal ID number which was super nice. Do not hesitate to buy!! If I could put pictures of both earrings on I would but I only seem to be able to upload one so the picture is of the rose gold ear climber!!
4,"One of the jewel’s prongs weren’t closed, so that one got loose and I had to fix it. Definitely love my earrings though!!! They are perfect for my big day."
4,Beautiful
4,These earrings are incredibly beautiful and unique and will be perfect for my wedding day. They also arrived very quickly and in lovely packaging. Very glad to have found this shop!
4,The earrings are absolutely beautiful !! They look exactly like the pictures and I can’t wait to wear them on my wedding day.
4,gorgeous! looks great as a pair (one on each ear) and looks great with the crawler on one ear depending on the hairdo- very very happy with the purchase of both!!!!!!!
4,"These are so cool looking, I can’t wait to wear them!! They are a little on the heavy side so I probably will wear them only for the reception (not the ceremony) but they are going to look SO GOOD with my leather jacket! Just an FYI these are glamorous enough that you probably don’t need a necklace with them!"
4,gorgeous!! stones were gorgeous and workmanship was well done!
4,Beautiful pair of earrings! I love it! Arrived quickly and safely. Thanks for a smooth transaction. :)
4,Item came as expected in regards to quality. Shipped in a timely manner. Aesthetically pleasing. Will give updates on day of wear on wedding date.
4,Just what I wanted for my wedding day. Thank you
4,They are stunning! I have pretty sensitive ears. The weight nor the material irritate them. Will stay in place pretty well. Highly recommend.
4,Love these earrings! Fast shipping and the seller is awesome and super helpful😊❤ will order again from this shop
4,I really really love this earrings :). They look nice on my ears and I got compliments on how lovely it looks. Thank you very much :). Highly recommend.

4,"Arrived quickly, well made delicate ear climbers. I have small ear lobes and they fit perfectly!"
4,"Sehr schön gestaltet, edel, was Besonderes! Für die Entfernung ging die Lieferung recht schnell."
4,"The earrings are lovely to look at, and look great on. But they hurt every time I wear them no matter how long or how often they always cause me pain....to the point I have to take them off....it makes me sad because they are seriously cute, hopefully it’s just me and the shape of my ears???"
4,Beautiful work of art. She loves them!
4,They are easy to insert and they look really nice on! They don't slide off and are comfortable to wear - aI actually forgot I was wearing them at one point:)
4,Lovely pair of earrings! Easy to put on as well :)
4,Lovely thank you
4,Very happy with my earrings.  No adverse reaction to the metal.  Shipped on time.  All's good ;-)
4,"I love the earings as they look modern and very pretty. BUT they fall out very quickly and can get lost. I know I lost one in the hospital.
The staff all felll in love with the remaining one and I am hoping the lost one will be returned."
4,"It got shipped out WAY sooner than promised - a nice surprise! They feel very delicate, I had thought I might wear these quite often (they are very beautiful but I *think* understated enough to do so), but I am afraid of breaking them. One fits my ear better than the other but the directions were very clear and I don’t think it will be a problem (must be something with me, I imagine, as all bodies are different). Overall very impressed"
4,beautiful! Just right for the wedding outfit that I wore.
4,So beautiful - tons of compliments! Easy to wear and stay put.
4,I chose these earrings for my wedding. So beautiful.
4,Simply beautiful ! Thanks a lot.
4,Honestly really obsessed with these earrings. I was worried they wouldn’t stay in place or they would be uncomfortable but I was wrong on both accounts. I have pretty sensitive ears and I haven’t noticed any issues with that either. These are really pretty and I would highly recommend them.
4,My daughter wore these on her wedding day and they were stunning! You won’t be disappointed!
4,"These are really beautiful - am planning on wearing for my wedding.  Everything arrived quickly and came with instructions.  They are lightweight without feeling cheap, so I will be able to wear them for the whole day."
4,Such a beautiful design! Easy to use and wear.
4,Earrings are beautiful! Perfect gift for the holidays
4,very pretty and very fast delivery
4,Good product by a  responsive vendor. Shipped on time and arrived quickly without any issues.
4,The set is TINY! Would not recommend.
4,"These are so cute, gave them to a friend and she loved them!!"
4,Perfect! Looks amazing on my giant earlobes and my daughter's nearly no lobes.
4,"Love these earrings, I get tons of compliments!"
4,"These have been my favorite purchase on Etsy so far! They are absolutely stunning and I get compliments all the time when I wear them. They look to be very high quality, not cheaply made. You will not be disappointed!"

4,These earrings are simply gorgeous and more than I could have hoped for. I definitely will be buying more from Miriam!

4,"Wirklich ein toller Händler!
Wunderschöner und preiswerter Silberschmuck. Der Versand ging auch noch schnell.
Hab aufgrund der tollen Erfahrung gleich noch ein Armband nachbestellt."
4,These earrings are adorable! Prompt shipping as well. Thank you SO much! Wonderful Etsy seller.
4,Love them. They are beautiful. But sometimes they fall off the line of the ear so they need adjusting. But that's all.
4,"Habe gekauft für ein Weihnachtsgeschenk, ist wunderschön, verzaubert den Ohr...Danke"
4,These little earrings are just the cutest! Thank you so much!
4,"Gorgeous pair of earrings! Absolutely love them :) Been wearing them almost every day, they are dainty but make a statement at the same time! Thank you very much! Will order again soon!"

4,Wear these almost every day! Love the quality.
4,Really flattering to the ear and staying subtle
4,Cute earrings! They shipped very quickly too!
4,"Very pretty, as pictured. The only thing is they do not come with backs, just a hook like some dangly earrings have. So you kind of have to squeeze that part behind your ear lobe to make sure they are on tight. I will try to see if I can put on my own backs to see if that helps but I wish they came more secure."
4,Great pair of earrings and excellent communication and shipping! Thanks!
4,The ear climbers are lovely and were as described.  I appreciate the timely information that was provided by the seller and would definitely purchase more items from them.

4,"Great earnings, quick delivery. Thanks"
4,Love these! Wore them to a wedding and received so many compliments on how gorgeous they were.

4,Simple and classy
4,"Delicate looking but exactly what I was wanting, awesome"
4,very pretty perfect size
4,Much smaller than photo. Read the description for accurate size. I didn't bother to read that because I assumed it would look like the photo.
4,"I've wanted to try an ear climber for a while, but wasn't really sure how they would look on me.  I decided on this gorgeous design and I'm so glad I did.  I love them (I ordered the pair).  They are fantastic...don't hesitate if you're thinking about these!"
4,I absolutely love these. They are simple and beautiful. They are one of my favourites!

4,"Tal y cómo se muestra en la foto. Envío rápido.
Un sutil y bonito adorno para la oreja."
4,Love my beautiful earrings !!!
4,This is such a lovely design. Very well made indeed and it is clear a lot of love and care went into it. My ears I have discovered are much smaller than I thought- the wave sits in the groove but it is so close the the edge of my ear haha
4,My second pair of these ear climbers after losing the first. Love them. Great customer service.
4,so beautiful and easy to put it!

4,"Love my necklace. It's perfect. Definitely get one. Everywhere I go, people ask about it. 🥰"
4,I am absolutely thrilled with this! It’s classy. Simple. Elegant. The chain is almost invisible which spotlights the Swarovski crystal “diamond”. The stone sparkles! And when on my neck it lays well and does not twist or tangle. I am impressed and I do not impress easily. I will be ordering other pieces.
4,I cant stop ordering these! I am blessed to have expensive jewelry and I get more compliments when I wear these necklaces. They are so unique and people just love them!

Delphine"
4,"Commande passée lundi 21/10, collier reçu le 23/10 (livraison rapide). 

Trop contente ! il correspond totalement à mes attentes, j'ai commandé le 8mm avec finition argenté, je ne quitte plus le collier, je dors avec et fait du sport avec, je le garde même sous la douche et il tient très bien.

Je vais le commander de nouveau en 6mm, pour le prix autant se faire plaisir.
Merci Creamelanie ^^"
4,I loved it! I get so many compliments 🥰
4,"Très jolie collier ,fait beaucoup d'effet .
Mélanie est super , très réactive , ça fait plaisir ! Merci encore une fois pour votre gentillesse. Je recommande cet article"
4,Je suis très satisfait de cet achat qui est un cadeau pour ma sœur. Le bijou m’a été envoyé très rapidement (malgré les conditions actuelles) et les contacts ont été très agréables. La qualité est superbe et conforme aux attentes.  C’est fin et c’est très joli. Je recommande !
4,"Livraison très rapide, beau produit pour un prix raisonnable. La vendeuse est à l'écoute et prend le temps de répondre, tout en personnalisant les commandes rapidement. Nous sommes très satisfaites de nos achats. Merci."
4,It is absolutely beautiful!! Exactly what I was hoping for-thank you so much!!
4,"Je recommande vivement, collier très joli avec ce cristal de Swarovski et de plus, je remercie Mélanie qui a été très compréhensible suite à mon erreur."
4,Très satisfaite ! Du plus bel effet. Vendeuse très à l'écoute et de très bon conseil. Pris en 8mm finition argent
4,"Le collier est encore plus beau en vrai ! Livraison rapide et créatrice à l'écoute, je recommande sans hésiter."

4,"Magnifique collier, discret et élégant. Bijou de bonne qualité, parfait pour les beaux jours qui arrivent. Envoi rapide et soigné.
Je recommande ♡
Merci beaucoup!"
4,"J'ai commandé ce collier le 10/11, il est en transit depuis le 14/11 et sa position n'a pas bougé!  Nous sommes le 20/11 et je ne l'ai toujours pas reçu! Inadmissible !!"
4,"Super beau, très rapide je suis super contente, je recommande fortement 😊"
4,"Ce collier est conforme à la photo. La pierre est brillante, c'est un joli bleu pour l'été. La longueur de 42 cm donne comme sur la photo. Je mets 4 étoiles car j'aurais aimé que le fil nylon soit plus épais. 
Merci pour vos créations."
4,Love it
4,"Merci Mélanie
Bien reçu, bien emballé, et tout mignon........"
4,"This is the second one I purchased.  The first was too small - my fault for not measuring right.  Gave it to my daughter and after seeing it on her I had to order one for me.  Its beautiful, simple, and sparkly.  I love it!"
4,I received my pendent today and it’s stunning!  It’s even more beautiful then I expected!  Seller let me know it might take longer to ship because of fewer planes I think she said. But Shipping was very fast considering it came from France to Florida.
4,"Très joli petit bijoux. Envoi très rapide dans un emballage soigné. Tout a été parfait. Je recommande vivement cette créatrice, bravo!"
4,"Le pendentif est très bien. C est l emballage qui laisse à désirer. Je veux l offrir à une relation de travail et il n y a même pas de carte de la créatrice. 
De plus on nous indique qu on peut joindre un mot avec le produit. Quelle ne fut pas ma déception de voir ce mot écrit à la main, sur un papier simple, découpé  avec un ciseaux cranteur.. Ça je peux le faire...
 En résumé je suis très déçue par la mise en valeur du produit..surtout de ne Pas avoir de carte de la créatrice. Je ne trouve pas ça normal, quand on achète sur etsy, ça me semble évident ! 
Ceci dit le collier est très bien et conforme à ce qui présenté. La livraison rapide."
4,Vendeur très sérieux ! jolie emballage et colis suivi. C'est une obligation qui devrait être mise en place par tous les vendeurs sur ETSY.
4,"Réalisées à ma demande en zirconium pour être assorties au collier que j'avais déjà reçu, ces boucles d'oreilles sont parfaites. Elégantes et réalisées avec soin, et toujours aussi joliment emballées.
Créatrice de bijoux recommandée."
4,"Bijoux très joli ! 
La longueur correspond exactement à mes attentes, le cristal est vraiment magnifique, le fil très discret et l'attache nickel !
Je ne peux que recommander !
La créatrice et vendeuse est très attentionnée."
4,"Commande arrivée rapidement, emballage nickel et petit mot personnalisé qui fait toujours plaisir. Je recommande !
Merci d'etre pro. quelque soit le montant de la commande."
4,Ravie de mon achat! Je recommande
4,"Collier d'une grande finesse de réalisation. Très élégant pour un prix plus que doux. Envoi rapide, joliment emballé avec soin. Vendeuse charmante et réactive aux questions posées. J'ai dès réception du collier commandé des boucles d'oreilles tout aussi jolies ! Un grand merci."

4,I have waited for this item and I never received it.
4,way too small really late shipping
4,"I'm loving these climbers....these are my first of this style so there was a learning curve to figure out how to get them in easily, but now it's a piece of cake. Love the minimalist design & hammered texture. They're perfect!"
4,"Pros:   Minimalistic. Super pretty. Everybody compliments them. I can sleep and shower and do everything with them. My hair hasn't gotten stuck in them yet. All-around superb purchase. 

 Cons:  really hard for me to put in my ears. Mostly because I think one of my holes is a little crooked.  I won't be taking them out anytime soon, and it's already been a few weeks, so it doesn't matter too much."
4,"A little difficult to put on at first but worth it! very delicate and minimal, I love them!"
4,"Absolutely love these earrings! They were a little tricky to get on the first time, since I haven't had a style like this before.  But they fit nicely, and were exactly what I wanted - something minimal but a little trendy.  I'm not one for big earrings and these are perfect!"
4,I seriously love them.  I pretty much haven't taken them out since I got them and find sleeping in them to be comfortable.  I did have to pull them apart a tiny bit just because they were hurting my ears but now they fit awesome.  But I love them!!!!
4,Love these so much for my girls!! They’re perfect!!
4,Absolutely beautiful! Stays in place (and one of my earlobes used to be gauged!) and shines nicely.
4,I love these climber earrings!! So comfortable and great quality! Thanks so much.
4,Absolutely LOVE these earrings! They're simple and gorgeous!
4,These are well crafted and they don't irritate my skin. I love how delicate and unique they look.
4,"Very dainty. They are very simple but beautifully made. 
A little tight on one of my ears but I think they'll adjust!"
4,These earrings are amazing! They look beautiful & I haven’t taken them out since I got them.
4,I love these earrings! Dainty and really cool looking! Thank you!!
4,Beautiful! Slipped much faster than promised. I love it
4,"Love them. Simple, unique, timeless."
4,These are gorgeous and perfect!
4,"These are simple, minimalist, and cute. They hug my earlobes perfectly and I can sleep in them. A wonderful change of style for me!"
4,Excellent quality and exactly as shown.  This style of earring is very comfortable and easy to wear... even with my sensitive ears!
4,"Pretty! A little difficult to put in, but nice all around. Thank you!"
4,"Delicate and minimal, exactly what I wanted. Thanks!"
4,These are my Go-To earrings.  I answer the phone all day and some earring can get annoying or in the way.  It's a small thing but when it happens all day long it can get frustrating.  I don't have a problem with these.  They are beautiful and easy to wear.
4,Love the ear crawlers! Thanks so much :)
4,Love these. Very unique and high quality.
4,Love my new earrings! Thank you for an excellent product & quick shipping!
4,Very cute and shipped fast! Will order again!

4,Arrived on time and exactly what I hoped for!
4,Love these earrings. Thank you!
4,They are so delicate and perfect! Thank you
4,"Lovely earrings, exactly what I wanted. They're so light I forget I have them on, and they can be worn overnight without poking you in the head."
4,"Nice design, but the quality lokks a bit so so..."
4,Very hard to put them on! And it is smaller than the picture...
4,"Not impressed. The right earring was loose and I couldn't get it to stay in place and, now, less than 24 hours after receiving them, it's already fallen out and lost.
Waste of money."
4,Absolutely beautiful and unique piece of jewellery
4,Sehr schöne Ohrringe und ideal an Festivals zu tragen.
4,"The customer service was fast and lovely. The package came with a handwritten note and a cute lollipop 🥰, thanks! The earcuffs are very nice - they are easy to put on, they don't pinch the ear and they fit snugly, and most of all - are as pretty as they were on the pictures provided by KivotosJewelry. 10/10 would buy again 😁"
4,Item is just as pictured! Just lovely. I did the free shipping to the US so it took awhile but I was offered faster shipping but would have to pay. So I decided to wait. Earrings are delicate and slightly smaller than I wanted but still wonderful! Would buy again.
4,Absolutely stunning ring! The blue stone has gold highlights that pair perfectly with the gold band. The band itself feels solid and well-made. The seller was very easy to work with and promptly responded to messages about customization.
4,"I LOVE this ring. It’s so beautiful! It has a nice shimmer indoors, but under the lights and sun it sparkles ✨ it took 3 months to get here because of covid and the fact that for me it was international shipping. After not having it weeks after the supposed arrival date I emailed them to see if they had any info on their side. They contacted the post office and responded to me very quickly about what was going on. (The item was already in my country just not scanned in yet). I was sad, but the wait was worth it for me. I love it so much. THANK YOU!!!
It also came BEAUTIFULLY packaged in a cute suede pouch covered in green tissue w/ a painted wood ladybug sticker. Also received a dried flower and sticker logo. Husband & I are big travelers and will probably frame the flower 💜"
4,Bought the ear crawlers together with a tiny single flower earring to wear on the other ear and I couldn't be happier. They fit perfectly and are as pretty as on the pictures. Also great communication and customer care from Eleni and her team. Thank you!
4,"It was a bday gift and you literally saved me with your super speedy delivery and help throughout. 

Amazing earrings - my friend loved them! 

Cant recommend enough. Will defo purchase from you again!"
4,"My daughter loved her gift!
Very stylish!"
4,"Absolutely love these, they’re so beautifully made. Lovely little hand written note was much appreciated aswell. Thanks so much :)"
4,"Ah beh, questo è per me! È davvero molto carino, ben fatto ed è resistente. È un oggetto particolare con colori vivaci, proprio come in foto. Ma non immaginatevi una cosa vistosa. Si fa notare con delicatezza. E di questi tempi anche i colori aiutano lo spirito! Dei venditori sono ugualmente entusiasta."
4,"I am so thrilled with my purchases. They are exactly as expected from the photo and came in such gorgeous packaging too. It all felt very special, like getting a gift from a friend! Highly recommend buying from this lovely seller, absolutely beautiful quality and attention to detail."

4,Beautifully hand crafted. I absolutely love it!
4,"The Ear Crawler Earring seen in the picture looks  even better seen in person. The enamel work is thorough, the flower petals are firmly attached , and the mechanisms designed for the earring to stay in place are strong.  The Kivotos Jewelry staff answered my email questions promptly and knowledgeably. They packed the earrings so they would not break in transit and shipped them soon after they were  ready to go. The earrings are darling and will probably  become family heirlooms."

4,"I love this tiny earrings, they're so beautiful and well made. Thank you so much!"
4,"The ring is just as pictured! They got my size wrong the first time but they were very quick to correct the mistake. I requested a new ring to be made instead of waiting for the one they first sent to be fixed and they paid for both delivery fees.
I’d recommend to see photos of the gem they’ll use since it can vary very much from the product description/photos.

Still, in spite of the this hiccup, they handled it very well and was a pleasure to purchase from their store :)"

The chain is delicate, the length is long, and the design adds to any outfit. It especially looks good with navy blue... Hagit makes beautiful pieces!"

4,"I ordered these earrings in black and another pair, back in November.  After several weeks of non-shipment, I had to reach out to the seller to check on my purchase.  Instead of shipping black, she shipped yellow (the description on my order even says black).  I pointed this out and she said she would send a black pair the next day.  After reaching out once again at the end of December, she has not provided a tracking number and the black earrings have not arrived.  Although the customer service has not been good, both pairs of earrings I ordered are of good quality."

4,"Gorgous, elegant and sue to disappear into my daughter's hands! Only way to solve is buying her one for herself!"

4,Beautiful earrings!!!  Fast shipping!!
4,Great item and received on time! Thank you!
4,"I opened the package and audibly gasped when I saw how gorgeous these earrings were! I wanted earrings that were edgy,
unique, yet classically beautiful to wear for my wedding day and I think I found them!"
4,"I like these earrings, but the posts are rough, not entirely smooth, and the unevenness is felt as soon as they go on. I really like the design and look of the spikes, but I wasn’t expecting a lack of quality, especially for the price paid, and also for the quality promise that the store offers for all their pieces. Still, they look lovely when on, so I’m really hoping they will hold up well for a long time to come."
4,"I’m very happy with my purchase! Those earrings are so cute and comfortable, I love them :) The shipping was very fast too! Thank you so much"

4,"fast delivery, superb communication, surprisingly light weight and of course gorgeous earrings!"
4,"Couldn't be happier with my purchase. A truly unique design, I will be passing these on to my daughter some day. The craftsmanship was superb. Thank you Zozi!"

4,"Very beautiful, versatile and elegant"
4,"Great Earring! Exactly as described, I love it!"
4,Beautiful and I didn’t have to wait long to receive them!!!!!
4,Magnifiques boucles d oreilles de très belle qualité et une livraison rapide. Merci pour votre création.
4,"jolies boucles, et livraison dans les temps service sérieux malgré mon appréhension du fait de la distance."
4,"Item arrived damaged. Seller ignored my first couple e-mails until I opened a case, even though when I had questions prior to purchasing, she responded very quickly. Seller told me to fix the crooked and bent posts myself with pliers. Seller still wanted me to reimburse her $15 dollars for her shipping costs along with incurring my own shipping costs (roughly $30 USD) to send the earrings back. If I am paying over $100 for earrings, I shouldn’t have to fix the poor workmanship myself with pliers. Horrible customer service, non responsive and does not have any pride in her product. Very disappointed, if I could give her less than 1 star, I would."
4,"Gorgeous and quality, but very lightweight. They don't tangle in curvy hair and it's nearly impossible to feel them when they're in. Amazing!"
4,Wunderschön! Bin total verliebt! 😍 War bestimmt nicht meine letzte Bestellung. Alles super gelaufen und schnelle Lieferung! Das war 100% nicht die einzige Bestellung.
4,"These are beautiful. I love jewelry that is just a little different so these fish are great. The one gold one in with all the silver, so unique. Worth the wait (about a month) to get them from Germany"
4,"It took quite some time for these to arrive because of COVID-related shipping restrictions (NOT the fault of the seller!) but when they did they were absolutely adorable! Excellent quality, fit beautifully, very comfortable, and even more charming in person than in the photos. I’ve already received multiple compliments."
4,Shipping was delayed due to Covid and the seller went above and beyond to let me know. Jewelry looks a little smaller in person but is delicate and dainty. I get so many compliments when I wear them.
4,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE these rings!!!  It couldn’t have fit my existing “everyday” wedding band set anymore perfect!!!  I also received earrings which are adorable as well!!!  I may have to add to my collection now!  Thank you!!!!
4,"Sehr filigran und einfach schön. Bin sehr glücklich und habe direkt ein weiteres Paar verschenkt, was ebenfalls für Begeisterung sorgte. Lieferung während der Weihnachtszeit ultraschnell, inklusive gratis Poliertuch, lieben Dank 🤗"
4,Subtle and classy but not bland- love them
4,Superschnell verschickt und so wunderschön!!! Bin so happy mit den Ohrsteckern. Ganz herzlichen Dank!
4,De très belles boucles d’oreilles. Elles sont délicates et très originales. Je les adore!
4,"Sehr außergewöhnliche Ohrringe. Freue mich sehr sie zu tragen. Wenn man Schlafen geht, doch besser ausziehen ;-)"

4,"Perfect, light, they make a statement while still being discreet. Service was again super fast and impeccable! I love this Etsy shop :))"
4,Soooooo schön!! Gern wieder! Martina
4,"The seller experience was great.  I live these.  They're REALLY small, so be prepared for that.  For me, that's a good thing.  I love the subtle statement that they make.   These arrived sooner than the items I ordered the same day from sellers here in the states.  I will definitely buy from this seller again!!"
4,Absolutely stunning craftsmanship. Exactly as pictured and exactly as I hoped it would be. Dainty yet sturdy. Thank you for all four gorgeous pieces!!!
4,I love these earrings!  The plastic backings broke rather quickly but quick fix very cheaply from Amazon and now I have enough to last a lifetime.  The earrings are super cute and very comfortable.  They arrived rather quickly.  You will be very happy with your purchase.
4,I absolutely adore these earrings. They're beautiful and excellent quality.
4,"A lovely piece of artwork of super quality! I am super happy with the purchase! :)))) Thank you so much!
Hope to be a regular customer. :)
Quick shipping.
The shop is highly recommended!"
4,Für das Ohr eine gute Größe. Da mir die Kette zu klein war habe ich auch die Ohrringe zurück geschickt. Ob sie gut am Ohr halten kann ich nicht bewerten.
4,"Verrutschen zwar leicht, aber ich liebe sie dennoch!"
4,"A delicate, dainty piece of jewellery. Looks lovely. A very good contact with the seller. Quick delivery as well. Thank you very much."

Sehr wertige Arbeit, bin begeistert!! Vielen Dank"
4,"Ich finde die Ohrringe wunderschön, Sie sehen sehr schön aus. Leider halten die Ohrringe bei mir nicht so, wie gedacht und somit muss ich Sie wieder zurück schicken, es liegt wohl an der Anatomie meiner Ohrläppchen."
4,"These fish earrings are not only adorable, but such good quality! Shipping has been so slow due to COVID-19, but the shop kept reassuring me the earrings were on their way! They even added a cute necklace (free of charge) as a thank you for waiting :)"
4,Sehr schön verarbeitet; waren sehr gut verpackt; es war ein Geburtstagsgeschenk für eine Freundin und sie hat sich riesig gefreut darüber; die Idee - das ein Fisch gegen den Strom schwimmt ist einfach toll und witzig
4,FABELHAFT ! ICH TRAGE ES SEHR GERN !
4,"J’aime bien ces boucles d’oreilles, elles sont petites /fines; sur la photo je m’étais fait l’idée qu’elles étaient plus grandes mais finalement je suis contente de la taille. Le seul bémol c’est qu’elles bougent beaucoup même si j’ai réserré la partie derrière l’oreille. Dommage parce que elles ne restent pas en place et ça me gêne. Je ne sais pas si c’est la forme de mes oreilles ou la conception de la partie arrière des boucles..."
4,"I am extremely happy with the three pieces of jewelry I bought as Christmas gifts for my three granddaughters. I love the message they send. VillaSorgenfrei estimated when they would arrive, and they did! I will definitely visit this site again!"
4,"No issues with shipping. And so glad I ordered these earrings as they are well-made and look so attractive ""climbing"" up the ears."
4,Lovely
4,Super light weight which is great for earrings!
4,"Die klemmen gefallen mir sehr gut, allerdings muß man wirklich sehr aufpassen, sie verrutschen leicht. Ist es aner wert :-)"
4,"Beautiful, well made earrings, so adorable and look fabulous on."
4,Absolutely stunning - very delicate but beautiful :)
4,Very unique earrings! I have gotten a lot of compliments for them!
4,"Tolle Idee, nur leider verdreht sich der Stecker sehr leicht, deshalb nur 4 Sterne"
4,"Wunderschön, sehr filigran und angenehm leicht, alles bestens 👍🏻"
4,"Tolle Ohrringe, hatte leider einen verloren und deswegen mir noch ein Paar gegönnt"
