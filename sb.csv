5,"Since I have wide AND small feet, I was actually able to buy shoes that weren't 1 or 2 sizes larger!  The extra widths that these shoes are available in made it possible to get the perfect sizing.  Ahhhh, relief!!  I will definitely buy more.  Thank you!",EXTREMELY comfortable!!

5,"I wear them around the house because they're comfortable and the elasticated upper edges prevent them slipping off.  However, their biggest plus is that the soft leather soles are perfect for wearing indoors on wooden floors because they don't leave skid marks (like some rubber soles can do).",Perfect for wearing indoors on wooden floors.

5,My favorite,Five Stars
5,"Big, big fan of these during the first few months of the pregnancy and the first few months post-nursing.  It won't help your cup size at all, but they easily add the extra inch or so that we all need when a few extra pounds come on.  I used these on nursing bras, regular bras, and even sports bras with no problems at all.  Even when playing soccer or doing high-impact workouts, the extenders stayed in place and stayed comfortable. Also nice to be able to buy a bra size down on the chest measurement when the price or availability is good, but the size is just a bit too small.
Every woman should have these in their lingerie drawer.",Good for every woman to have.
5,So great I bought two pairs!,Five Stars
5,"Very comfortable and great for the value, but do not expect them to hold up like a more expensive pair. The leather sole is very thin. With most leather shoes you can replace the heal at least once or twice before the sole is worn out, but you won't be able to with these. The kidskin leather is very soft and comfortable though. And for the price, you can afford to just replace the whole shoe rather than putting on a new heal or sole.",COMFORTABLE
5,My wife wears them for line dancing. She wears out a pair about every 6-8 months. She enjoys these and great price!,She enjoys these and great price!
5,"My son is a mechanic, on his knees, on cement, all day. He Loves them",Great lined pants
5,I have several pairs of Sanuk Yoga Mat Flip Flops!  I use them for indoor shoes instead of house shoes and they last way longer than house shoes!  Then of course I have different pairs to wear when I go out on warm spring days and in the summer.  They are super comfy...especially between your toes and I would definitely recommend them!,Love my Sanuk's!

5,"I was a little nervous going with such a bold bright color, but it works with so many outfits. I originally got a grey pair and regretted it, so decided to go with the pink. The only thing is they leave blisters, but any shoes like this will.",Love the color!
1,looks weird,One Star
1,I am extremely disappointed with this product. I purchased it as a gift which I will not be able to give. The material looks and feels really cheap. There are 3 zippers and one of them is a completely different tone of gold. Overall this is poorly made and overpriced. Do not recommend!,I am extremely disappointed with this product

1,"I purchased this wallet as a temporary one while mine was being repaired. It was a complete piece of junk. The card holders were so loose, my credit cards and ID were always falling out. I almost lost them many times. After about a week, my solution was to put a rubber band around the wallet to keep them in - which kind of defeats the purpose of a wallet. Once I got my wallet back, I threw this one out.",You will lose your credit cards...
1,Too small and not well made. Not even worth the price to return it and I love cats so was really excited to buy this sweatshirt. Disappointed.,Runs very small and not well made!

The lenses are cheap plastic too and with the mirror tint it's so noticeable that everything is warped in its reflection",These are so big it's ridiculous. I don't even ...
1,"The material is very thin and the sewing is poorly done. One side of the zipper goes beyond the hemline of the back of the dress! It sticks out and if cut, the zipper will not work properly and fall off. I understand this is a cheaper priced dress but isn't basic quality control and an inspection a given?",The material is very thin and the sewing is poorly ...

1,"Im 180 lbs (5' 2"") and wear a 38C.
orderd a C cup which covered my half of my breasts nicely.. once i clipped it on it looked like i was braless again. It did not support my breast nor did it perk it up at all. i ended up giving it to my 13 year old sister who wears 34A or size small sports bras.

1,"The fabric is itchy and visibly cheap, wouldn't wear it to a costume party.",One Star
1,"Washed and hung to dry these leggings once.  Got to wear them 1 1/2 times.  I went to the beach with my husband to go fishing.  What to wear,  of course my cute leggings.  I looked down and the right leg well ripped completely off at the thigh area! For no reason at all.  What's a girl to do but scrunch up the left leg to the thigh area and continue fishing.  Funny now but not then.  Will never buy again unless you really like to wear clothes once.",cute and adorable but NO
1,"These flannel pants were great until I washed them.  The must have shrunk a good 3 inches!  My son is 10 and I purchased the 10-12 size.  Had I known they would shrink this much, I would have sized up.  Not worth the money!!",These flannel pants were great until I washed them
3,The straps are good quality and what I was expecting as a replacement for the original. However the price was very high ($29) compared to the original watch and strap ($35),Check costs

3,Good shoes cute but I did not like the satin fabric and it looked more off white than white in my opinion. Wore these for my wedding shoes because for some reason no one wanted to sell white shoes at the time! so I had to go with these a little too foo foo in my opinion but desperate times calls for desperate measures. Cute shoes just not for me but I stuck it out but at least they were comfortable,Good shoes cute but I did not like the satin ...

3,"I bought this ring as a gift and my friend was absolutely thrilled. That is, until the stones started falling out after a few months of wear. She wore it everyday, but not for messy activities or in the water, etc. One of the large stones broke in half somehow and then half of it fell out. This ring is beautiful; however, it seems to be rather cheaply made. It would be just fine for gentle use, but not for daily wear over a long period of time.",Beautiful but cheap.
3,Really cute but a half size too small and can't return them because I threw out the box.,Three Stars
3,I was a little disappointed that I paid 4.99 for them to gift wrap it and they put it in a box no wrapping and or ribbon,dont pay for gift wrapping

3,"I've never had trouble wearing any sort of material in the ear piercings I had as an adolescent, but not so with the second piercing I added to my ears last year. Now it seems that only gold will do.  Because I prefer real gemstone to CZ jewelry, I decided to look for inexpensive 10K white gold gemstone earrings. I love rhodolite, so these were the first I bought from GemKing. At 5mm, they are a great size for a second piercing. They are large enough to not look like a tiny dot in my ear, but not so big as to interfere with anything I might wear in the other hole.

After trying these out I bought additional pairs from GemKing, in amethyst, white topaz, and mystic blue topaz. I even splurged for a more expensive 6mm pair in a mystic canary color. I am fully color coordinated, and while the earrings are not as substantial as more expensive studs, they are wearable 24/7. While in bed the posts don't poke because they are too long, nor do they bend because they are too weak. I recommend them to anyone looking for an inexpensive way to fill out their earring collection with real gold, real gemstone jewelry.",Nice for a second ear piercing
3,Not sturdy enough,Three Stars
3,It doesn't fits as well as I expected also its fabric is not good because after the first wash it looks like two-year used. Really.,I'm gonna give it 3 stars.

3,"Good shoe that is comfortable. I played two rounds and, on one of the shoes, the heel part on the sole was flapping. I added superglue but after another two rounds I see that the loose part is gone. I would expect a shoe to last longer than this.
The shoe is waterproof and I enjoy walking in them.","OK, comfortable but the heel part came off"
3,The crystal is not very usefull for anything its smaller then a dime its more like half the size of a dime and the most its good for is super glueing it to a necklace i don't recomend it if you have children,its smaller then a dime
3,"I am a big cri de coeur fan and own more than 5 pairs. I've been on a hunt for booties exactly this color and style that were vegan and was SO excited to find these from one of my favorite brands. The boots are great, fit great BUT the problem is (and i've not experienced this with any of their other boots) is that the fabric started peeling the first day i wore them And it got worse when I wore them two days in a row. Big chunk of the tan fabric came off in the back and little pieces around the strap. I am pretty disappointed by the fact that it started doing that and SO fast. And these boots aren't cheap! I will keep wearing them but I'm gonna have to like color in the missing pieces or something cuz i cant return them at this point. lol",love these booties BUT...

3,"They are not the best,meaning there are a few things wrong with them.  The waist is sooo... high on these pants.  I've had other scrub pants and they fit alot better.  The seams were only sewed with one single line stitch.  Nursing scrub pants need to be made better.  I've said my peace, now I'm better.  Pam Vehrs",3

3,"I love Invicta watches and own several.  I thought I would try this one, but unfortunately it was way too large and way too heavy with the bracelet band on.

3,"There is no shamrock on the shoulder... or, anywhere on the hoodie. No shamrocks. Nowhere on the entire hoodie does it have the words ""Philly, PA."" The stripes on the arms have stitching facing out that reads ""Cast & Crew Season 8."" Fits well. Many compliments. I wish the shamrock was on the left shoulder, as described. Small brown stain on the left arm upon opening. Again, this is a very cool hoodie, but I'm just a little disappointed.","this is a very cool hoodie, but I'm just a little disappointed"

3,"The hat was far too large.  I'm 6ft 1"" and this thing enveloped my head, with the sides extending partway down and over my ears.

Aside from that it looks reasonably well made.  The velcro thing at the back tightens it nicely.  Sadly this thing wasn't made for me however.  Looks a decent cap if you've got a sizable dome.",One Size Not Fitting All
